1</span>CHAPTER I<br />
HONOURS</h2>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, there&rsquo;s that stick.&nbsp; What can he want?&rsquo; 
sighed one of a pair of dignified elderly ladies, in black silk, to the 
other, as in a quiet country-town street they saw themselves about to be 
accosted by a man of about forty, with the air of a managing clerk, who 
came up breathlessly, with a flush on his usually pale cheeks.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Miss Lang; I beg pardon!&nbsp; May I be allowed a few words with 
Miss Marshall?&nbsp; I know it is unusual, but I have something unusual to 
tell her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nothing distressing, I hope, Mr. Morton,&rsquo; said one of the 
ladies, startled.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh no, quite the reverse,&rsquo; he said, with a nervous laugh; 
&lsquo;in fact, I have unexpectedly come into a property!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Indeed!&rsquo; with great astonishment, &lsquo;I congratulate 
you,&rsquo; as the colour mounted in his face, pleasant, honest, but with 
the subdued expression left by long years of patience in a subordinate 
position.</p>
<p><!-- page 2--><a name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
2</span>&lsquo;May I ask&mdash;&rsquo; began the other sister.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I hardly understand it yet,&rsquo; was the answer; &lsquo;but I 
must go to town by the 5.10 train, and I should like her to hear it from 
myself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, certainly; it does you honour, Mr. Morton.&rsquo;</p>
<p>They were entering the sweep of one of those large substantial houses on
the outskirts of country towns that have a tendency to become 
boarding-schools, and such had that of the Misses Lang been long before the
days of the High School.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Fortunately it is recreation-time,&rsquo; said Miss Lang, as she 
conducted Mr. Morton to the drawing-room, hung round with coloured 
drawings, in good taste, if stiff, and chiefly devoted to interviews with 
parents.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Poor little Miss Marshall!&rsquo; murmured one sister, when they 
had shut him in.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What a loss she will be!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She deserves any good fortune.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She does.&nbsp; Is it not twenty years?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Twenty-two next August, sister.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Yes, it was twenty-two years since Mary Marshall had been passed from 
the Clergy Orphan Asylum to be English governess at Miss Lang&rsquo;s 
excellent school at Hurminster.&nbsp; In that town resided, with her two 
sons, Mrs. Morton, the widow of a horse-dealing farmer in the late Mr. 
Marshall&rsquo;s parish.&nbsp; On discovering the identity of the English 
governess with the little girl who had admired the foals, lambs, and 
chickens in past times, Mrs. Morton gave invitations to tea.&nbsp; She was 
ladylike, the sons unexceptionable, and no objection could reasonably be 
made by the Misses Lang, though the acquaintance was regretted by them.</p>
<p><!-- page 3--><a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>Mr. 
Morton, the father, had died in debt and distress, and the eldest son had 
been thankful for a clerkship in the office of Mr. Burford, a solicitor in 
considerable practice, and man of business to several of the county 
magnates.&nbsp; Frank Morton was not remarkable for talent or enterprise, 
but he was plodding and trustworthy, methodical and accurate, and he had 
continued in the same position, except that time had made him senior 
instead of junior clerk.&nbsp; Partly from natural disposition, partly from
weight of responsibility, he had always been a grave, steady youth, one of 
those whom their contemporaries rank as sticks and muffs, because not 
exalted by youthful spirits or love of daring.&nbsp; His mother and brother
had always been his primary thought; and his recreations were of the 
sober-sided sort&mdash;the chess club, the institute, the choral 
society.&nbsp; He was a useful, though not a distinguished, member of the 
choir of St. Basil&rsquo;s Church, and a punctual and diligent 
Sunday-school teacher of the least interesting boys.&nbsp; To most of the 
world of Hurminster he was almost invisible, to the rest utterly 
insignificant.&nbsp; Even his mother was far less occupied with him than 
with his brother Charles, who was much handsomer, more amusing and 
spirited, as well as far less contented or easy to be reckoned upon.&nbsp; 
But there was one person to whom he was everything, namely, little 
brown-eyed, soft-voiced Mary Marshall.</p>
<p>She felt herself the happiest of creatures when, after two years of 
occasional evening teas and walks to Evensong at St. Basil&rsquo;s, it was 
settled that she should become his wife as soon as his salary should <!-- 
page 4--><a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>be increased,
and Charlie be in condition to assist in supporting his mother.&nbsp; Ever 
since, Mary had rested on that hope, and the privileges it gave.&nbsp; She 
had loyally informed the Misses Lang, who were scarcely propitious, but 
could not interfere, as long as their pupils (or they believed so) surmised
nothing.&nbsp; So the Sunday evening intercourse became more frequent, and 
in the holidays, when the homeless governess had always remained to 
superintend cleaning and repairs, there were many pleasant hours spent with
kind old Mrs. Morton, who, if she had ever wished that Frank had waited 
longer and chosen some one with means, never betrayed it to the girl whom 
she soon loved as a daughter.</p>
<p>Two years had at first been thought of as the period of patience.&nbsp; 
Charles had a situation as clerk in a shipping office at Westhaven, a small
seaport about twenty miles off, and his mother was designing to go to keep 
house for him, when he announced that his banns had been asked with the 
daughter of the captain and part-owner of a small trading vessel of the 
port.</p>
<p>The Hurminster couple must defer their plans till further promotion; and
so far from helping his mother, Charles ere long was applying to her, when 
in need, for family expenses.</p>
<p>Then came a terrible catastrophe.&nbsp; Charlie had been ill, and in his
convalescence was taken on a voyage by his father-in-law.&nbsp; There was a
collision in the Channel, and the <i>Emma Jane</i> and all on board were 
lost.&nbsp; The insurance did not cover the pecuniary loss; debts came to 
light, and nothing was left for the widow and her three children <!-- page 
5--><a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>except a seaside 
lodging-house in which her father had invested his savings.</p>
<p>The children&rsquo;s education and great part of their maintenance must 
fall on their uncle; and again his marriage must wait till this burthen was
lessened.&nbsp; Old Mrs. Morton died; and meetings thus became more 
difficult and infrequent.&nbsp; Frank had hoped to retain the little house 
where he had lived so long; but his sister-in-law&rsquo;s demands were 
heavy, and he found himself obliged to sell his superfluous furniture, and 
commit himself to the rough attendance of the housekeeper at the office, 
where two rooms were granted to him.</p>
<p>Thus had year after year gone by, unmarked except by the growth of the 
young people at Westhaven and the demand of their mother on the savings 
that were to have been a nest-egg, while gray threads began to appear in 
Mary&rsquo;s hair, and Frank&rsquo;s lighter locks to leave his temples 
bare.</p>
<p>So things stood when, on this strange afternoon, Miss Marshall was 
summoned mysteriously from watching the due performance of an imposition, 
and was told, outside the door, that Mr. Morton wanted to speak to her.</p>
<p>It was startling news, for though the Misses Lang were kindly women, and
had never thrown obstacles in the way of her engagement, they had merely 
permitted it, and almost ignored it, except when old Mrs. Morton was dying,
and they had freely facilitated her attendance.&nbsp; &lsquo;Surely 
something as dreadful as the running down of the <i>Emma Jane</i> must have
happened!&rsquo; thought Mary as she sped to the drawing-room.&nbsp; She 
was a little brown mouse <!-- page 6--><a name="page6"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 6</span>of a woman, with soft dark eyes, smooth hair, 
and a clear olive complexion, on which thirty-eight years of life and 
eighteen of waiting had not left much outward trace; for the mistresses 
were good women, who had never oppressed their underling, and though she 
had not met with much outward sympathy or companionship, the one well of 
hope and joy might at times suffer drought, but had never run dry, any more
than the better fountain within and beyond.</p>
<p>In she came, with eyes alarmed but ready to console.&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh, 
Frank, what is it?&nbsp; What can I do for you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is no bad news,&rsquo; was his greeting, as he put his arm 
round her trembling little figure and kissed her brow.&nbsp; &lsquo;Only 
too good.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, is Mrs. Charles going to be married?&rsquo; the only hopeful 
contingency she could think of.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;but, Mary, an extraordinary incident 
has taken place.&nbsp; I have inherited a property.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A property?&nbsp; You are well off!&nbsp; Oh, thank God!&rsquo; 
and she clasped her hands, then held his.&nbsp; &lsquo;At last!&nbsp; But 
what?&nbsp; How?&nbsp; Did you know?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I knew of the connection, but that the family had never taken 
notice of my father.&nbsp; As to the rest I was entirely unprepared.&nbsp; 
My great-grandfather was a younger son of the first Lord Northmoor, but for
some misconduct was cast off and proscribed.&nbsp; As you know, my 
grandfather and father devoted themselves to horses on the old farm, and 
made no pretensions to gentility.&nbsp; The elder branch of the family was 
once numerous, but it must have since <!-- page 7--><a 
name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>dwindled till the old 
lord was left with only a little grandson, who died of diphtheria a short 
time before his grandfather.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Poor old man!&rsquo; began Mary.&nbsp; &lsquo;Then&mdash;oh! do 
you mean that he died too?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes; he was ill before, and this was a fatal blow.&nbsp; It 
appears that he was aware that I was next in the succession, and after the 
boy&rsquo;s death had desired the solicitor to write to me as 
heir-at-law.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Heir-at-law!&nbsp; Frank, do you mean that you are&mdash;&rsquo; 
she said, turning pale.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Baron Northmoor,&rsquo; he answered, &lsquo;and you, my patient 
Mary, will be the baroness as soon as may be.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, Frank!&rsquo;&mdash;and there was a rush of 
tears&mdash;&lsquo;dear Frank, your hard work and cares are all 
over!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am not sure of that,&rsquo; he said gravely; &lsquo;but, at 
least, this long waiting is over, and I can give you everything.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But, oh!&rsquo; she cried, sobbing uncontrollably, with her face 
hidden in her handkerchief.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mary, Mary! what does this mean?&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you 
understand?&nbsp; There&rsquo;s nothing to hinder it now.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She made a gesture as if to put him back from her, and struggled for 
utterance.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is very dear, very good; but&mdash;but it can&rsquo;t be 
now.&nbsp; You must not drag yourself down with me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That is just nonsense, Mary.&nbsp; You are far fitter for this 
than I am.&nbsp; You are the one joy in it to me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You think so now,&rsquo; she said, striving to hold herself back;
&lsquo;but you won&rsquo;t by and by.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do you think me a mere boy to change so <!-- page 8--><a 
name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>easily?&rsquo; said the 
new lord earnestly.&nbsp; &lsquo;I look on this as a heavy burthen and very
serious responsibility: but it is to you whom I look to sweeten it, help me
through with it, and guard me from its temptations.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If I could.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Come, Mary, I am forced to go to London immediately, and then on 
to the funeral.&nbsp; I shall miss the train if I remain another 
minute.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t send me away with a sore heart.&nbsp; Tell me 
that your affection has not been worn out by these weary years.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You cannot think so, Frank,&rsquo; she sobbed.&nbsp; &lsquo;You 
know it has only grown.&nbsp; I only want to do what is best for 
you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not another word,&rsquo; he said, with a fresh kiss.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;That is all I want for the present.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He was gone, while Mary crept up to her little attic, there to weep out 
her agitated, uncertain feelings.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, he is so good!&nbsp; He deserves to be great.&nbsp; That I 
should be his first thought!&nbsp; Dear dear fellow!&nbsp; But I ought to 
give him up.&nbsp; I ought not to be a drag on him.&nbsp; It would not be 
fair on him.&nbsp; I can love him and watch him all the same; but oh, how 
dreary it will be to have no Sunday afternoons!&nbsp; Is this 
selfish?&nbsp; Is this worldly?&nbsp; Oh, help me to do right, and hold to 
what is best for him!&rsquo;</p>
<p>And whenever poor Mary had any time to herself out of sight of curious 
eyes, she spent it in concocting a letter that went near to the breaking of
her constant heart.</p>

HONOURS REFLECTED</h2>
<p>On the beach at Westhaven, beyond the town and harbour, stood a row of 
houses, each with a garden of tamarisk, thrift, and salt-loving flowers, 
frequented by lodgers in search of cheap sea breezes, and sometimes by 
families of yachting personages who liked to have their headquarters on 
shore.</p>
<p>Two girls were making their way to one of these.&nbsp; One was so tall 
though very slight, that in spite of the dark hair streaming in the wind, 
she looked more than her fifteen years, and her brilliant pink-and-white 
complexioned face confirmed the impression.&nbsp; Her sister, keeping as 
much as she could under her lee, was about twelve years old, much more 
childish as well as softer, smaller, with lighter colouring and blue 
eyes.&nbsp; Going round the end of the house, they entered by the back 
door, and turning into a little parlour, they threw off their hats and 
gloves.&nbsp; The younger one began to lay the table for dinner, while the 
elder, throwing herself down panting, called out&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ma, here&rsquo;s a letter from uncle.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll open 
it.&nbsp; <!-- page 10--><a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
10</span>I hope he&rsquo;s not crusty about that horrid low millinery 
business.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, do,&rsquo; called back a voice across the tiled 
passage.&nbsp; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve had no time.&nbsp; This girl has put me 
about so with Mrs. Leeson&rsquo;s luncheon that I&rsquo;ve not had a 
moment.&nbsp; Of all the sluts I&rsquo;ve ever been plagued with, 
she&rsquo;s the very worst, and so I tell her till I&rsquo;m ready to 
drop.&nbsp; What is it then, Ida?&rsquo; as an inarticulate noise was 
heard.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/fp.jpg">
<img alt="Frontispiece&mdash;Ma! ma!" src="images/fp.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>&lsquo;Ma! ma! uncle is a lord!&rsquo; came back in a gasp.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Uncle&rsquo;s a lord!&nbsp; Oh!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Your uncle!&nbsp; That stick of a man!&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t be 
putting your jokes on me, when I&rsquo;m worrited to death!&rsquo; 
exclaimed Mrs. Morton, in fretful tones.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No joke.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s true&mdash;Lord Northmoor.&rsquo;&nbsp;
And this brought Mrs. Morton out of the kitchen in her apron and bib, with 
a knife in one hand and a bunch of parsley in the other.&nbsp; She was a 
handsome woman, in the same style as Ida, but her complexion had grown 
harder than accorded with the slightly sentimental air she assumed when she
had time to pity herself.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is! it is!&rsquo; persisted Ida, reading scraps from the 
letter; &lsquo;&ldquo;Title and estates devolve on me&mdash;family 
bereavements&mdash;elder line extinct.&rdquo;&lsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Give me the letter.&nbsp; Oh, you gave me such a turn!&rsquo; 
said Mrs. Morton, sinking into a chair.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What&rsquo;s the row?&rsquo; said another voice, as a sturdy 
bright-eyed boy, between the ages of his sisters, came bouncing in.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;I say, I want my grub&mdash;and be quick!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, Herbert, my dear boy,&rsquo; and his mother <!-- page 11--><a
name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>hugged him, &lsquo;your
uncle is a lord, and you&rsquo;ll be one one of these days.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I say, don&rsquo;t lug a man&rsquo;s head off.&nbsp; Who has been
making a fool of you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Uncle Frank is Lord Northmoor,&rsquo; said Ida impressively.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I say, that&rsquo;s a good one!&rsquo; and Herbert threw himself 
into a chair in fits of laughter.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is quite true, Herbert,&rsquo; said his mother.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;Here is the letter.&rsquo;</p>
<p>A bell rang sharply.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Bless me! I shall not hear much more of that bell, I hope.&nbsp; 
Run up, Conny, and say Mrs. Leeson&rsquo;s lunch will be up in a moment, 
but we were hindered by unexpected news,&rsquo; said Mrs. Morton, bustling 
into the kitchen.&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh dear! one doesn&rsquo;t know where one 
is.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Let her ring,&rsquo; said Ida.&nbsp; &lsquo;Send her off, bag and
baggage!&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve done with lodgings and milliners and telegraphs,
and all that&rsquo;s low.&nbsp; We shall all be lords and ladies, and ever 
so rich.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hold hard!&rsquo; said Herbert, who had got possession of the 
letter.&nbsp; &lsquo;He doesn&rsquo;t say so.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He&rsquo;ll be nasty and mean, I daresay,&rsquo; said Ida.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;What does he say?&nbsp; I hadn&rsquo;t time to see.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Herbert read from the neat, formal, distinct writing: &ldquo;I do not 
yet know what is in my power, nor what means I may be able to command; but 
I hope to make your position more comfortable and to give my nephew and 
nieces a really superior education.&nbsp; You had better, however, not take
any steps till you hear from me again.&rdquo;&nbsp; There, Ida, lots of 
schooling, that&rsquo;s all.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 12--><a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
12</span>&lsquo;Nonsense, Bertie; he must&mdash;if he is a lord, what are 
we?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Hunger postponed this great question for a little while; but dinner had 
been delayed till the afternoon school hour had passed, and indeed the 
young people agreed that they were far above going to their present 
teachers any more.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We must acquire a few accomplishments,&rsquo; said Ida.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;Uncle never would afford me lessons on the piano&mdash;such a shame;
but he can&rsquo;t refuse me now.&nbsp; Dancing lessons, too, we will have;
and then, oh, Conny! we will go to Court, and how they will admire 
us!&rsquo;</p>
<p>At which Herbert burst out laughing loudly, and his mother rebuked 
him.&nbsp; &lsquo;You will be a nobleman, Herbert, and your sisters a 
nobleman&rsquo;s sisters.&nbsp; Why should they not go to Court like the 
best of them?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s all my eye!&rsquo; said Herbert.&nbsp; &lsquo;The 
governor has got a young woman of his own, hasn&rsquo;t he?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That dowdy old teacher!&rsquo; said Ida.&nbsp; &lsquo;Of course 
he won&rsquo;t marry her now.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She will be artful enough to try to hold him to it, you may 
depend on it,&rsquo; said Mrs. Morton; &lsquo;but I shall take care he 
knows what a shame and disgrace it would be.&nbsp; Oh no; he will not 
dare.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She is awfully old,&rsquo; said Ida.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not near so old as Miss Pottle, who was married yesterday,&rsquo;
said Constance, who, at the time of her father&rsquo;s death, and at other 
times when the presence of a young child was felt to be inconvenient at 
home, had stayed with her grandmother at Hurminster, and had grown fond of 
Miss Marshall.</p>
<p><!-- page 13--><a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
13</span>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t talk about what you know nothing about, 
Constance,&rsquo; broke in her mother.&nbsp; &lsquo;Your uncle, Lord 
Northmoor, ain&rsquo;t going to lower and demean himself by dragging a mere
school teacher up into the peerage, to cut out poor Herbert and all his 
family.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s that bell again!&nbsp; I shall go and let Mrs. 
Leeson know how we are situated, and that I shall give her notice one of 
these days.&nbsp; Clear the table, girls; we don&rsquo;t know who may be 
dropping in.&rsquo;</p>
<p>This done, chiefly by Constance, the sisters put on their hats, and 
sallied forth with their astounding news to such of their friends as were 
within reach, and by the time they had finished their expedition they were 
convinced of their own nobility, and prepared to be called Lady Ida and 
Lady Constance Northmoor on the spot.</p>
<p>When they came in they found the parlour being prepared for company, and
were sent to procure sausages and muffins for tea.&nbsp; Mrs. Morton had, 
on reflection, decided that it was inexpedient to answer her brother-in-law
till she had ascertained, as she said, her just rights, and she had invited
to tea Mr. and Mrs. Rollstone and, to Constance&rsquo;s delight, his little
daughter Rose, their neighbours a few doors off; but as Rose was attending 
classes, it had been useless to go to her before.</p>
<p>Mr. Rollstone was a great authority, for he had spent the best part of 
his life in what he termed the first families of the highest circles.&nbsp;
He had been hall boy to a duke, footman to a viscountess, valet to an earl,
butler to a right honourable baronet, M.P., and when he had retired on the 
death of the baronet and marriage with the housekeeper he had <!-- page 
14--><a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>brought away a 
red volume, by name <i>Burke&rsquo;s Peerage</i>, by which, as well as by 
his previous knowledge, he was enabled to serve as an oracle respecting all
owners of yachts worthy of consideration.&nbsp; If their names were not 
recorded in that book, he scorned them as &lsquo;<i>parvenoos</i>,&rsquo; 
however perfect their vessels might be in the eyes of mariners.&nbsp; The 
edition was indeed a quarter of a century old, but he had kept it up to 
date, by marking in neatly all the births, deaths, and marriages from the 
<i>Gazette</i>&mdash;his daily study.&nbsp; His daughter, a nice, 
modest-looking girl of fourteen, Constance&rsquo;s chief friend, came 
too.</p>
<p>His wife was detained by her lodgers, but when he rolled in, with the 
book under his arm, there was a certain resemblance between himself and it,
for both were broad and slightly dilapidated&mdash;the one from gout, the 
other from wear, and the red cover had faded into a nondescript 
whity-brown, or browny-white, not unlike the complexion of a close-shaven 
face.&nbsp; He was carefully arrayed in evening costume, and was very 
choice in his language, being, in fact, much grander than all his 
aristocratic masters rolled into one; so that though Mrs. Morton tried to 
recollect that she was a great lady and he had been a servant, force of 
habit made her feel his condescension when he held out his puffy white 
hand; and, with a gracious bend of his yellow-gray head, said, &lsquo;Allow
me to offer my congratulations, Mrs. Morton.&nbsp; I little suspected my 
proximity to a lady so nearly allied to the aristocracy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am sure you are very kind, Mr. Rollstone.&nbsp; <!-- page 
15--><a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>I had no 
notion&mdash;Ida can tell you I was quite overcome&mdash;though when I came
to think of it, my poor, dear Morton always did say he had high 
connections, but I always thought it was one of his jokes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then as I understand, Mrs. Morton, the lamented deceased was 
junior to the present Lord Northmoor?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, poor dear!&nbsp; Oh, if he had but lived and been eldest, he
would have become his honours ever so much better!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And oh, Mr. Rollstone, what are we?&rsquo; put in Ida 
breathlessly, while Rose squeezed Constance&rsquo;s hand in schoolgirl 
fashion.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Indeed, Miss Ida, I fear I cannot flatter you with any change in 
your designation.&nbsp; If your respected parent had survived he might have
become the Honourable Charles, but only by special grant from Her 
Majesty.&nbsp; It was so in the case of the Honourable Frances Fordingham, 
when her brother inherited the title.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then at least I am an Honourable!&rsquo; exclaimed Mrs. 
Morton.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am afraid not, Mrs. Morton.&nbsp; I know of no precedent for 
such honours being bestowed on a relict; but as I understand that Lord 
Northmoor is no longer in his first youth, your son might succeed to the 
title, and, in that case, his sisters might be&rsquo;&mdash;he paused for a
word&mdash;&lsquo;ennobled.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then does not it really make any difference to us?&rsquo; 
exclaimed Mrs. Morton.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That would rest in the bosom of his lordship,&rsquo; said Mr. 
Rollstone solemnly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I declare it is an awful shame,&rsquo; burst out Ida, while 
Constance cooed &lsquo;Dear uncle!&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 16--><a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
16</span>&lsquo;Hush, hush, Ida!&rsquo; said her mother.&nbsp; &lsquo;Your 
uncle has always treated us handsomely, and we have every reason to expect 
that he will continue to do so.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He ought to have us to live with him in his house in London, and 
take us to Court,&rsquo; said Ida.&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh, Mr. Rollstone, is he 
not bound to do that?&rsquo;</p>
<p>And Constance breathed, &lsquo;How delicious!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Rollstone perhaps had his doubts of the figures Mrs. and Miss Morton
would cut in society, but he contented himself with saying, &lsquo;It may 
be well to moderate your expectations, Miss Ida, and to remember that Lord 
Northmoor is not compulsorily bound to consult any interests but his 
own.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If he does not, it is perfectly abominable,&rsquo; cried Mrs. 
Morton, &lsquo;towards his poor, only brother&rsquo;s children, with 
Herbert his next heir-apparent.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Heir-presumptuous,&rsquo; solemnly corrected Mr. Rollstone, at 
which Ida looked at Constance, but Constance respected Rosie&rsquo;s 
feelings, and would not return her sister&rsquo;s glance, only blushed, and
sniggered.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Heir-apparent is only the eldest son, who cannot be displaced by 
any contingency.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And there&rsquo;s a horrid, little, artful school teacher, who 
drew him in years ago&mdash;before I was married even,&rsquo; said Mrs. 
Morton.&nbsp; &lsquo;No doubt she will try to keep him now.&nbsp; Most 
likely she always knew what was going to happen.&nbsp; Cannot he be set 
free from the entanglement?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; gasped Constance.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That is serious,&rsquo; observed Mr. Rollstone gravely.&nbsp; 
<!-- page 17--><a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
17</span>&lsquo;It would be an unfortunate commencement to have an action 
for breach of promise of marriage.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She would never dare,&rsquo; said Mrs. Morton.&nbsp; &lsquo;She 
is as poor as a rat, and could not do it!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, Mrs. Morton,&rsquo; said Mr. Rollstone, &lsquo;if I may be 
allowed to tender my poor advice, it would be that you should be very 
cautious and careful not to give any offence to his lordship, or to utter 
what might be reported to him in a sinister manner.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, I know every one has enemies!&rsquo; said Mrs. Morton, 
tossing her head.</p>
<p>After this disappointment there was rather less interest displayed when 
Mr. Rollstone proceeded to track out and explain the whole Northmoor 
pedigree, from the great lawyer, Sir Michael Morton, who had gained the 
peerage, down to the failure of the direct line, tracing the son from whom 
Francis and Charles Morton were descended.&nbsp; Certainly Miss Marshall 
must have been wonderfully foresighted if she had engaged herself with a 
view to the succession, for at the time it began, the last Lord Northmoor 
had two sons and a brother living!&nbsp; There was also a daughter, the 
Honourable Bertha Augusta.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is she married?&rsquo; demanded Mrs. Morton.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is not marked here, and if it had been mentioned in the 
papers, I should not have failed to record it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And how old is she?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The author of this peerage would never be guilty of the solecism 
of recording a lady&rsquo;s age,&rsquo; said Mr. Rollstone gravely; 
&lsquo;but as the Honourable Arthur was born in 1848, and the Honourable 
<!-- page 18--><a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
18</span>Michael in 1850, we may infer that the young lady is no longer in 
her first youth.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And not married?&nbsp; Nearly Fr&mdash;Lord Northmoor&rsquo;s 
age.&nbsp; She must be an old cat who will set her mind on marrying 
him,&rsquo; sighed Mrs. Morton, &lsquo;and will make him cut all his own 
relations.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then Mary Marshall might be the better lookout,&rsquo; said 
Ida.</p>
<p>&lsquo;She could never be unkind,&rsquo; breathed little Constance.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There is no knowing,&rsquo; said Mr. Rollstone oracularly; 
&lsquo;but the result of my observations has been that the true high-bred 
aristocracy are usually far more affable and condescending than those 
elevated from a lower rank.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, I do hope for Miss Marshall,&rsquo; said Constance in a 
whisper to Rose.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nasty old thing&mdash;a horrid old governess,&rsquo; returned 
Ida; and they tittered, scarcely pausing to hear Mr. Rollstone&rsquo;s 
announcement of the discovery that he had entered the marriage in 1879 of 
the Honourable Arthur Michael to Lady Adela Emily, only daughter of the 
Earl of Arlington, and the death of the said Honourable Arthur by a 
carriage accident four years later.</p>
<p>Then Herbert tumbled in, bringing a scent of tea and tar, and was 
greeted with an imploring injunction to brush his hair and wash his 
hands&mdash;both which operations he declared that he had performed, 
spreading out his brown hands, which might be called clean, except for 
ingrained streaks of tar.&nbsp; Mr. Rollstone tried to console his mother 
by declaring that it was aristocratic to know how to handle <!-- page 
19--><a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>the ropes; and 
Herbert, sitting among the girls, began, while devouring sausages, to 
express his intention of having a yacht, in which Rose should be taken on a
voyage.&nbsp; No, not Ida; she would only make a fool of herself on board; 
and besides, she had such horrid sticking-out ears, with a pull at them, 
which made her scream, and her mother rebuke him; while Mr. Rollstone 
observed that the young gentleman had much to learn if he was to conform to
aristocratic manners, and Herbert under his breath hung aristocratic 
manners, and added that he was not to be bored, at any rate, till he was a 
lord; and then to salve any shock to his visitor, proceeded to say that his
yacht should be the <i>Rose</i>, and invite her to a voyage.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Certainly not till you can behave yourself,&rsquo; replied Rose; 
and there was a general titter among the young people.</p>
<h2><!-- page 20--><a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

WHAT IS HONOUR?</h2>
<p>&lsquo;Here is a bit of news for you,&rsquo; said Sir Edward Kenton, as,
after a morning of work with his agent, both came in to the family 
luncheon.&nbsp; &lsquo;Mr. Burford tells me that the Northmoor title has 
descended on his agent, Morton.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That stick!&rsquo; exclaimed George, the son and heir.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not altogether a stick, Mr. Kenton,&rsquo; said the bald-headed 
gentlemanly agent.&nbsp; &lsquo;He is very worthy and 
industrious!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Frederica Kenton and her brother looked at each other as if this 
character were not inconsistent with that of a stick.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Poor man!&rsquo; said their mother.&nbsp; &lsquo;Is it not a 
great misfortune to him?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I should think him sensible and methodical,&rsquo; said Sir 
Edward.&nbsp; &lsquo;By the way, did you not tell me that it was his 
diligence that discovered the clause to which our success was owing in the 
Stockpen suit?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, Sir Edward, through his indefatigable diligence in reading 
over every document connected <!-- page 21--><a name="page21"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 21</span>with the matter.&nbsp; I take shame to 
myself,&rsquo; he added, smiling, &lsquo;for it was in a letter that I had 
read and put aside, missing that passage.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then I am under great obligations to him?&rsquo; said Sir 
Edward.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I could also tell of what only came to my knowledge many years 
later, and not through himself, of attempts made to tamper with his 
integrity, and gain private information from him which he had steadily 
baffled.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There must be much in him,&rsquo; said Lady Kenton, &lsquo;if 
only he is not spoilt!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am afraid he is heavily weighted,&rsquo; said Mr. 
Burford.&nbsp; &lsquo;His brother&rsquo;s widow and children are almost 
entirely dependent on him, more so, in my opinion, than he should have 
allowed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Exactly what I should expect from such a sheep,&rsquo; said 
George Kenton.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There is this advantage,&rsquo; said the lawyer, &lsquo;it has 
prevented his marrying.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;At least that fatal step has been averted,&rsquo; said the lady, 
smiling.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But unluckily there is an entanglement, an endless engagement to 
a governess at Miss Lang&rsquo;s.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh,&rsquo; cried Freda, who once, during a long absence of the 
family abroad, had been disposed of at Miss Lang&rsquo;s, &lsquo;there was 
always a kind of whisper among us that Miss Marshall was engaged, though it
was high treason to be supposed to know.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Was that the one you called Creepmouse?&rsquo; asked her 
brother.</p>
<p>&lsquo;George, you should not bring up old misdeeds!&nbsp; She was a 
harmless old thing.&nbsp; I believe the tinies <!-- page 22--><a 
name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>were very fond of her, 
but we elders had not much to do with her, only we used to think her 
horridly particular.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Does that mean conscientious?&rsquo; asked her father.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Perhaps it does; and though I was rather a goose then, I really 
believe she was very kind, and did not want to be tiresome.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A lady?&rsquo; asked her mother.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I suppose so, but she was so awfully quiet there was no 
knowing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Poor thing!&rsquo; observed Lady Kenton, in a tone of 
commiseration.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I think Morton told me that she was a clergy-orphan,&rsquo; said 
Mr. Burford, &lsquo;and considered her as rather above him, for his father 
was a ruined farmer and horse-breeder, and I only took him into my office 
out of respect for his mother, though I never had a better bargain in my 
life.&nbsp; Of course, however, this unlucky engagement cannot 
stand.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Indeed!&rsquo; said the Baronet drily.&nbsp; &lsquo;Would you 
have him begin his career with an act of baseness?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No&mdash;no, Sir Edward, I did not mean&mdash;&rsquo; said Mr. 
Burford, rather abashed; &lsquo;but the lady might be worked on to resign 
her pretensions, since persistence might not be for the happiness of either
party; and he really ought to marry a lady of fortune, say his cousin, Miss
Morton, for I understand that the Northmoor property was never 
considerable.&nbsp; The late Mr. Morton was very extravagant, and there are
heavy burthens on the estate, by the settlement on his widow, Lady Adela, 
and on the late Lord&rsquo;s daughter.&nbsp; Miss Lang tells me likewise 
<!-- page 23--><a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>that 
Miss Marshall is full of doubts and scruples, and is almost persuaded that 
it is incumbent on her to drop the engagement at any cost to herself.&nbsp;
She is very conscientious!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Poor thing!&rsquo; sighed more than one voice.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is a serious question,&rsquo; continued the solicitor, 
&lsquo;and I own that I think it would be better for both if she were 
induced to release him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Has she no relations of her own?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;None that I ever heard of.&nbsp; She has always spent her 
holidays at Miss Lang&rsquo;s.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, Mr. Burford,&rsquo; exclaimed Freda, &lsquo;I think you are
frightfully cruel to my poor little Creep-mouse.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nay, Freda,&rsquo; said her mother; &lsquo;all that Mr. Burford 
is considering is whether it would be for the happiness or welfare of 
either to be raised to a position for which she is not prepared.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I thought you were on her side, mother.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There are no sides, Freda,&rsquo; said her father 
reprovingly.&nbsp; &lsquo;The whole must rest with the persons chiefly 
concerned, and no one ought to interfere or influence them in either 
direction.&rsquo;&nbsp; Having thus rebuked Mr. Burford quite as much as 
his daughter, he added, &lsquo;Where is Lord Northmoor now?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He wrote to me from Northmoor after the funeral, Sir Edward, 
saying that he would return on Saturday.&nbsp; Of course, though three 
months&rsquo; notice would be due, I should not expect it, as I told him at
first; but he assures me that he will not leave me till my arrangements for
supplying his place are complete, and he will assist me as 
usual.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 24--><a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
24</span>&lsquo;It is very proper of him,&rsquo; said Sir Edward.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It will be awkward in some ways,&rsquo; said Mr. Burford.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;Yet I do not know what I could otherwise have done, he had become so
necessary to me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Stick or no stick,&rsquo; was the family comment of the Kentons, 
&lsquo;there must be something in the man, if only his head is not 
turned.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Which,&rsquo; observed Sir Edward, &lsquo;is not possible to a 
stick with a real head, but only too easy to a sham one.&rsquo;</p>

HONOURS WANING</h2>
<p>&lsquo;And who is the man?&rsquo;&nbsp; So asked a lady in deep mourning
of another still more becraped, as they sat together in the darkened room 
of a Northmoor house on the day before the funeral.</p>
<p>The speaker had her bonnet by her side, and showed a kindly, clever, 
middle-aged face.&nbsp; She was Mrs. Bury, a widow, niece of the late Lord;
the other was his daughter, Bertha Morton, a few years younger.&nbsp; She 
was not tearful, but had dark rings round her eyes, and looked haggard and 
worn.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The man?&nbsp; I never heard of him till this terrible loss of 
poor little Mikey.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then did he put in a claim?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh no, but Hailes knew about him, and so, indeed, did my 
father.&nbsp; It seems that three generations ago there was a son who 
followed the instincts of our race further than usual, and married a 
jockey&rsquo;s daughter, or something of that sort.&nbsp; He was set up in 
a horse-breeding farm and cut the connection; but it seems that there was 
always a sort of <!-- page 26--><a name="page26"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 26</span>communication of family events, so that Hailes 
knew exactly where to look for an heir.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not a jockey!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh no, nothing so diverting.&nbsp; That would be fun!&rsquo; 
Bertha said, with a laugh that had no merriment in it.&nbsp; &lsquo;He is a
clerk&mdash;an attorney&rsquo;s clerk!&nbsp; What do you think of that, 
Lettice?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Better than the jockey.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, very respectable, they say&rsquo;&mdash;with a sound of 
disgust.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is he young?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No; caught early, something might be done with him, but 
there&rsquo;s not that hope.&nbsp; He is not much less than forty.&nbsp; 
Fancy a creature that has pettifogged, as an underling too, all his 
life.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Married?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank goodness, no, and all the mammas in London and in the 
country will be running after him.&nbsp; Not that he will be any great 
catch, for of course he has nothing&mdash;and the poor place will be 
brought to a low ebb.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And what do you mean to do, Birdie?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Get out of sight of it all as fast as possible!&nbsp; Forget that
horses ever existed except as means of locomotion,&rsquo; and Bertha got up
and walked towards the window as if restless with pain, then came back.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I shall get rid of all I can&mdash;and come to live as near as I 
can to Whitechapel, and slum!&nbsp; I&rsquo;m free now.&rsquo;&nbsp; Then 
looking at her cousin&rsquo;s sorrowful, wistful face, &lsquo;Work, work, 
work, that&rsquo;s all that&rsquo;s good for me.&nbsp; Soberly, Lettice, 
this is my plan,&rsquo; she added, sitting down again.&nbsp; &lsquo;I know 
how it all is left.&nbsp; This new man is to have enough to go on <!-- page
27--><a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>upon, so as not
to be too beggarly and bring the title into contempt.&nbsp; He is only 
coming for to-morrow, having to wind up his business; but I shall stay on 
till he comes back, and settle what to do with the things here.&nbsp; Adela
and I have our choice of them, and don&rsquo;t want to leave the place too 
bare.&nbsp; Then I shall sell the London house, and all the rest of the 
encumbrances, and set up for myself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not with Adela?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh no; Adela means to stick by the old place, and I 
couldn&rsquo;t do that for a constancy&mdash;oh no,&rsquo; with a 
shudder.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Does she?&rsquo; in some wonder.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Her own people don&rsquo;t want her.&nbsp; The Arlingtons are 
with her now, but I fancy she would rather be sitting with us&mdash;or 
alone best of all, poor dear.&nbsp; You see, she is a mixture of the angel 
that is too much for some people.&nbsp; How she got it I don&rsquo;t know, 
not among us, I should think, though she came to us straight out of the 
schoolroom, or I fancy she would never have come at all.&nbsp; But oh, 
Lettice, if you could have seen her how patient she has been throughout 
with my father, reading him all about every race, just because she thought 
it was less gall and wormwood to her than to me, and going out to the 
stables to satisfy him about his dear Night Hawk, and all the rest of 
it.&nbsp; When she was away for that fortnight over poor little Michael, I 
found to the full what she had been, and then after that, back she comes 
again, as white as a sheet, but all she ever was to my father, and more 
wonderful than all, setting herself to reconcile him to the notion of this 
new heir of his&mdash;and I do believe, if my father <!-- page 28--><a 
name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>had not so suddenly 
grown worse, she would have made us have him up to be introduced&mdash;all 
out of rectitude and duty, you know, for Adela is the shyest of mortals, 
and recoils by nature from the underbred far more than we do.&nbsp; In 
fact, I rather like it.&nbsp; It gives me a sensation.&nbsp; I had ten 
times rather this man were a common sailor, or a tinker, than just a stupid
stick of a clerk!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then Adela means to stay at the Dower House?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, she has rooted herself there by all her love to her poor 
people, and I fancy, too, that she does not want to bring Amice up among 
all the Arlington children, who are not after her pattern, so she intends 
to bear the brunt of it, and not leave Northmoor, unless the new-comers 
turn out unbearable.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She goes away with her brother now.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh yes, she must, and Lord Arlington is fond of her in a 
way!&nbsp; Can&rsquo;t you stay on with me, Lettice?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I wish I could, my dear Birdie, but I am anxious about Mary; I 
don&rsquo;t think I must stay later than Sunday.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes; you are too devoted a mother for me to absorb.&nbsp; Never 
mind, you will be in London, and I shall soon be within reach of you.&nbsp;
You are a comfortable person, Lettice.&rsquo;</p>

THE PEER</h2>
<p>Poor Miss Lang!&nbsp; After all her care that her young pupils&rsquo; 
heads should not be turned by folly about marriage and noblemen, the very 
event she had always viewed as most absurdly improbable had really 
occurred, and it was impossible to keep it a secret; though Miss Marshall 
did her very best to appear as usual, heard lessons with her accustomed 
diligence, conducted the daily exercises, watched over the instructions by 
masters, and presided over the needlework.&nbsp; But she grew whiter, more 
pinched, and her little face more mouse-like every day, and the elder girls
whispered fancies about her.&nbsp; &lsquo;She had no doubt heard that Lord 
Northmoor had broken it off!&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;A little poky 
attorney&rsquo;s clerk, of course he would.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Poor dear 
thing, she will go into a consumption!&nbsp; Didn&rsquo;t you hear her 
cough last night?&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;And then we&rsquo;ll all throw 
wreaths into her grave!&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Oh, that was only Elsie 
Harris!&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Nonsense, Mabel, I&rsquo;m sure it was her, 
poor thing.&nbsp; Prenez garde, la vieille Dragonne vient.&rsquo;</p>
<p>That Lord Northmoor was to come back by the <!-- page 30--><a 
name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>mail train was known, 
and Miss Lang had sent a polite note to invite him to afternoon tea on the 
Sunday.&nbsp; The church to which he had been for many years devoted was a 
district one, and Miss Lang&rsquo;s establishment had their places in the 
old parish church, so there was not much chance of meeting in the morning, 
though one pupil observed to another that &lsquo;she should think him a 
beast if they did not meet him on the way to church.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It is to be feared that she had to form this opinion, but on the other 
hand, by the early dinner-time, tidings pervaded the school that Lord 
Northmoor had been at St. Basil&rsquo;s, and sung in his surplice just as 
if nothing had happened!&nbsp; The more sensational party of girls further 
averred that he had been base enough to walk thither with Miss Burford, and
that Miss Marshall had been crying all church time.&nbsp; Whether this was 
true or not, it was certain that she ate scarcely any dinner, and that Miss
Lang insisted on administering a glass of wine.</p>
<p>Moreover, when dinner was finally over, she quietly crept up to her own 
room, and resumed her church-going bonnet&mdash;a little black net, with a 
long-enduring bunch of violets.&nbsp; Then she knelt down and entreated, 
&lsquo;Oh, show me Thy will, and give me strength and judgment to do that 
which may be best for him, and may neither of us be beguiled by the world 
or by ambition.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Then she peeped out to make sure that the coast was clear&mdash;not that
she was not quite free to go where she pleased, but she dreaded eyes and 
titters&mdash;out at the door, to the corner of the lane where for many a 
Sunday afternoon there had been a quiet <!-- page 31--><a 
name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 31</span>tryste and walk.&nbsp; 
Her heart beat so as almost to choke her, and she hardly durst raise her 
eyes to see if the accustomed figure awaited her.&nbsp; Was it the 
accustomed figure?&nbsp; Her eyes dazzled so under her little holland 
parasol that she could hardly see, and though there was a movement towards 
her, she felt unable to look up till she heard the words, &lsquo;Mary, at 
last!&rsquo; and felt the clasp of the hand.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, Frank&mdash;I mean&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You mean Frank, your own Frank; nothing else to you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ought you?&rsquo;&nbsp; And as she murmured she looked up.&nbsp; 
It was the same, but still a certain change was there, almost 
indescribable, but still to be felt, as if a line of toil and weariness had
passed from the cheek.&nbsp; The quiet gray eyes were brighter and more 
eager, the bearing as if ten years had been taken from the forty, and 
though Mary did not perceive the details, the dress showing that his 
mourning had not come from the country town tailor and outfitter, even the 
soft hat a very different article from that which was wont to replace the 
well-cherished tall one of Sunday mornings.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I had not much time,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;but I thought this 
would be of the most use,&rsquo; and he began clasping on her arm a gold 
bracelet with a tiny watch on it.&nbsp; &lsquo;I thought you would like 
best to keep our old ring.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If&mdash;if I ought to keep it at all,&rsquo; she faltered.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, Mary, I will not have an afternoon spoilt by any folly of 
that sort,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is it folly?&nbsp; Nay, listen.&nbsp; Should you not get <!-- 
page 32--><a name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 32</span>on far far
better without such a poor little stupid thing as I am?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I always thought I was the stupid one.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You&mdash;but you are a man.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;So much the worse!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes; but, Frank, don&rsquo;t you see what I mean?&nbsp; This 
thing has come to you, and you can&rsquo;t help it, and you are descended 
from these people really; but it would be choice for me, and I could not 
bear to feel that you were ashamed of me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Never!&rsquo; he exclaimed.&nbsp; &lsquo;Look here, Mary.&nbsp; 
What should I do without you to come back to and be at rest with?&nbsp; All
the time I was talking to those ladies and going through those fine rooms, 
I was thinking of the one comfort I should have when I have you all to 
myself.&nbsp; See,&rsquo; he added, going over the arguments that he had no
doubt prepared, &lsquo;it is not as if you were like poor Emma.&nbsp; You 
are a lady all over, and have always lived with ladies; and yet you are not
too grand for me.&nbsp; Think what you would leave me to&mdash;to be 
wretched by myself, or else&mdash;&nbsp; I could never be at home with 
those high-bred folk.&nbsp; I felt it every moment, though Miss Morton was 
very kind, and even wanted me to call her Birdie.&nbsp; I <i>did</i> feel 
thankful I could tell her I was engaged.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You did!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes; and she was very kind, and said she was glad of it, and 
hoped soon to know you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, Frank dear, I am sure no one ever was more really 
noble-hearted than you,&rsquo; she almost sobbed; &lsquo;you know how I 
shall always feel it; but yet, but yet I can&rsquo;t help thinking you 
ought to leave <!-- page 33--><a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
33</span>it a little more unsettled till you have looked about a little and
seen whether I should be a very great disadvantage to you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Seen whether I could find such a dear, unselfish little woman, 
eh?&nbsp; No, no, Mary, put all that out of your head.&nbsp; We have not 
loved one another for twenty years for a trumpery title to come between us 
now!&nbsp; And you need not fear being too well off for the position.&nbsp;
The agent, Hailes, has been continually apologising to me for the smallness
of the means.&nbsp; He says either we must have no house in London, or else
let Northmoor.&nbsp; He cannot tell me yet exactly what income we shall 
have, but the farms don&rsquo;t let well, and there is not much ready 
money.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Every one says you ought to marry a lady of fortune.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My dear Mary, to what would you condemn me?&nbsp; What sort of 
lady of fortune do you think would take an old stick like me for the sake 
of being my Lady?&nbsp; I really shall begin to believe you are tired of 
it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Stick! oh no, no.&nbsp; Staff, if&rsquo;&mdash;and the manner in 
which she began to cling was answer full and complete; indeed, as she saw 
that her resistance had begun to hurt him as much as herself, she felt 
herself free to throw herself into the interests, and ask, &lsquo;Is 
Northmoor a very nice place?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not so pretty as Cotes Kenton outside.&nbsp; A great white house,
with a portico for carriages to drive under, and not kept up very well, 
patches of plaster coming off; but there is a beautiful view over the 
woods, with a purple moor beyond.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 34--><a name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
34</span>&lsquo;And inside?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, rather dreary, waiting for you to make it homelike.&nbsp; 
They have not lived there much for some time past.&nbsp; Lady Adela has 
lived in the Dower House, and will continue there.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did you see much of them?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not Lady Adela.&nbsp; Poor lady, she had her own relations with 
her.&nbsp; She had not by any means recovered the loss of her little boy, 
and I can quite understand that it must have been too trying for her to see
me in his place.&nbsp; I understand from Hailes&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Your Mr. Burford,&rsquo; said Mary, smiling.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That she is a very refined, rather exclusive and domestic lady, 
devoted to her little girl, and extremely kind to the poor.&nbsp; Indeed, 
so is Miss Morton, but she prefers the London poor, and is altogether 
rather flighty, and what Hailes calls an unconventional young lady.&nbsp; 
There was a very nice lady with her, Mrs. Bury, the daughter of a brother 
of the late Lord, a widow, and very kind and friendly.&nbsp; Both were very
good-natured, Miss Morton always acted hostess, and talked 
continually.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;About her father?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh no, I do not think he had been a very affectionate father, and
their habits and tastes had been very different.&nbsp; Lady Adela seems to 
have latterly been more to him.&nbsp; Miss Morton was chiefly concerned to 
advise me about politics and social questions, and how to deal with the 
estate and the tenants.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He seemed somewhat to shudder at the recollection, and Mary certainly 
conceived a dread of the <!-- page 35--><a name="page35"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 35</span>ladies of Northmoor.&nbsp; It was further 
elicited that he meant to help Mr. Burford through all the work and 
arrangements consequent on his own succession, indeed, to remain at his 
post either till a successor was found, or the junior sufficiently 
indoctrinated to take the place.&nbsp; Of course, as he said, six 
months&rsquo; notice was due, but Mr. Burford has waived this.&nbsp; During
this time he meant to go to see &lsquo;poor Emma&rsquo; at Westhaven, but 
it was not an expedition he seemed much to relish, and he wished to defer 
it till he could definitely tell what it would be in his power to do for 
her and her children, for whose education he was really anxious, rejoicing 
that they were still young enough to be moulded.</p>
<p>Then came the tea at Miss Lang&rsquo;s&mdash;a stately meal, when the 
two ladies were grand; Lord Northmoor became shy and frozen, monosyllabic, 
and only spasmodically able to utter; and Mary felt it in all her nerves 
and subsided into her smallest self, under the sense that nobody ever would
do him justice.</p>
<h2><!-- page 36--><a name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
36</span>CHAPTER VI<br />
THE WEIGHT OF HONOURS</h2>
<p>The next was a fortnight of strange and new experiences.&nbsp; Lord 
Northmoor spent most of his days over the papers in the office, so much his
usual self, that Mr. Burford generally forgot, and called to him as 
&lsquo;Morton&rsquo; so naturally that after the first the other clerks 
left off sniggering.</p>
<p>There Sir Edward called on him, and in an interview in his sitting-room 
at the office asked him to a quiet dinner, together with the solicitor; but
this was hardly a success, for Mr. Burford, being at home with the family, 
did all the talking, and Frank could not but feel in the presence of his 
master, and had not a word to say for himself, especially as George and 
Freda looked critical, and as if &lsquo;That stick&rsquo; was in their 
minds, if not on their lips.&nbsp; The only time when he approached a thaw 
was when in the hot summer evening Lady Kenton made him her companion in a 
twilight stroll on the terraces, when he looked at the roses with delight, 
and volunteered a question about the best sorts, saying that the garden at 
Northmoor had been much <!-- page 37--><a name="page37"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 37</span>neglected, and he wanted to have it in good 
order, &lsquo;that is&rsquo;&mdash;blushing and correcting 
himself&mdash;&lsquo;if we can live there.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Lady Kenton noted the &lsquo;we&rsquo; and was sorry to be here 
interrupted.&nbsp; &lsquo;We shall do nothing with him till we get him 
alone,&rsquo; she said.&nbsp; &lsquo;We must have him apart from Mr. 
Burford.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Before this, however, they had to meet him at a very splendid party, 
given with all the resources of the Burford family at their villa, when the
county folks, who had no small curiosity to see the new peer, were invited 
in full force, and the poor peer felt capable of fewer words than ever to 
throw at them.</p>
<p>Lady Kenton ventured on asking Mrs. Burford to introduce her to Miss 
Marshall, taking such presence for granted.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, Lady Kenton, really now I did not think that foolish affair 
should be encouraged.&nbsp; It is such an unfortunate thing for him; and as
Miss Lang and I agreed, it would be so much better for both of them if it 
were given up.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is there anything against her?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh no, not at all; only that, poor thing, she is quite unfitted 
for the position, and between ourselves, in the condition of the property, 
it is really incumbent on his Lordship to marry a lady of fortune.&nbsp; At
his age he cannot afford romance,&rsquo; she added with a laugh, being in 
fact rather inferior to her husband in tone, or perhaps in manners.&nbsp; 
Indeed, she was of all others the person who most shrivelled up the man 
whom she had always treated like a poor dependent, till her politeness 
became still more <!-- page 38--><a name="page38"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 38</span>embarrassing.&nbsp; Among all the party, Sir 
Edward and Lady Kenton were those with whom he was most nearly at ease, for
they had nothing to revoke in their manners towards him, and could, without
any change, treat him as an equal whom they respected; nor did they try to 
force him forward into general conversation&mdash;as did his 
host&mdash;with the best intentions.</p>
<p>Lady Kenton, under cover of Miss Burford&rsquo;s piano, asked him 
whether she might call on Miss Marshall, and saw him flush with gratitude 
and pleasure, as he answered, &lsquo;It will be very kind in 
you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Lady Kenton knew enough of the ways of the school to understand when to 
make her visit, so as to have a previous conversation with Miss Lang, whom 
of course she already knew.&nbsp; That lady received her in one of the 
drawing-rooms, the folding doors into the other were shut.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have told Miss Marshall,&rsquo; said Miss Lang, &lsquo;that the
room is always at her service to receive Lord Northmoor, though, in fact, 
he never comes till after business hours.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He is behaving very well.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very honourably indeed; but poor Miss Marshall is in a very 
distressing position.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Indeed!&nbsp; Is she not very happy in his constancy?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She is in great doubt and difficulty,&rsquo; said Miss Lang, 
&lsquo;and we really hardly know how to advise her.&nbsp; She seems sure of
his affection, but she shrinks from entering on a position for which she is
so unfit.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 39--><a name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
39</span>&lsquo;Is she really unfit?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Miss Lang hesitated.&nbsp; &lsquo;She is a complete lady, and as good 
and conscientious a creature as ever existed; but you see, Lady Kenton, her
whole life has been spent here, ever since she was sixteen, she has known 
nothing beyond the schoolroom, and how she is ever to fulfil the duties of 
a peeress, and the head of a large establishment, I really cannot 
see.&nbsp; It might be just misery to her, and to him, too.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Has she good sense?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, very fair sense.&nbsp; We can trust to her judgment 
implicitly in dealing with the girls, and she teaches well, but she is not 
at all clever, and could never shine.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Perhaps a person who wanted to shine might be 
embarrassing,&rsquo; said Lady Kenton, rather amused.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, it might be so.&nbsp; The poor man is certainly no star 
himself, but surely he needs some one who would draw him out, and push him 
forward, make a way in society, in fact.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That might not be for his domestic happiness.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Perhaps not, but your Ladyship has not seen what a poor little 
insignificant creature she is&mdash;though, indeed, we are both very fond 
of her, and should be very much relieved not to think we ought to 
strengthen her scruples.&nbsp; For, indeed,&rsquo; and tears actually came 
into the good lady&rsquo;s eyes, &lsquo;I am sure that though she would 
release him for his good, that it would break her heart.&nbsp; Shall I call
her?&nbsp; Ah!&rsquo; as a voice began to become very audible on the other 
side of the doors, &lsquo;she has a visitor.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not Lord Northmoor.&nbsp; It is a woman&rsquo;s voice, and a loud
one.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 40--><a name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
40</span>Presently, indeed, there was a tone that made Lady Kenton say, 
&lsquo;People do scent things very fast.&nbsp; It must be some one wanting 
to apply for patronage.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am a little afraid it is that sister-in-law of his,&rsquo; said
Miss Lang, lowering her voice.&nbsp; &lsquo;I saw her once at the choral 
festival&mdash;and&mdash;and I wasn&rsquo;t delighted.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Perhaps I had better come another day,&rsquo; said Lady 
Kenton.&nbsp; &lsquo;We seem to be almost listening.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Even as the lady was taking her leave, the words were plainly 
heard&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Artful, mean-spirited, time-serving viper as you are, bent on 
dragging him down to destruction!&rsquo;</p>

MORTONS AND MANNERS</h2>
<p>&lsquo;Shillyshally,&rsquo; quoth Mrs. Charles Morton over her 
brother-in-law&rsquo;s letter.&nbsp; &lsquo;Does he think a mother is to be
put off like that?&rsquo;</p>
<p>So she arrayed herself in panoply of glittering jet and nodding plumes, 
and set forth by train to Hurminster to assert her rights, and those of her
children, armed with a black sunshade, and three 
pocket-handkerchiefs.&nbsp; She did not usually wear mourning, but this was
an assertion of her nobility.</p>
<p>In his sitting-room, wearing his old office coat, pale, wearied, and 
worried, the Frank Morton, &lsquo;who could be turned round the finger of 
any one who knew how,&rsquo; appeared at her summons.</p>
<p>She met him with an effusive kiss of congratulation.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;Dearest Frank!&nbsp; No, I must not say Frank!&nbsp; I could hardly 
believe my eyes when I read the news.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nor I,&rsquo; said he.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nor the dear children.&nbsp; Oh, if your dear brother were only 
here!&nbsp; We are longing to hear all about it,&rsquo; she said, as she 
settled herself in the arm-chair, a relic of his mother.</p>
<p><!-- page 42--><a name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 42</span>He
repeated what he had told Mary about the family, the Park, and the London 
house.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I suppose there is a fine establishment of servants and 
carriages?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The servants are to be paid off.&nbsp; As to the carriages and 
the rest of the personal property, they go to Miss Morton; but the 
executors are arranging about my paying for such furniture as I shall 
want.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And jewels?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There are some heirlooms, but I have not seen them.&nbsp; How are
the children?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very well; very much delighted.&nbsp; Dear Herbert is the noblest
boy.&nbsp; He was ready to begin on his navigation studies this next term, 
but of course there is no occasion for that now.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is a pity, with his taste for the sea, that he is too old to 
be a naval cadet.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The army is a gentleman&rsquo;s profession, if he must have 
one.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I must consider what is best for him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, my Lord,&rsquo; impressively.&nbsp; &lsquo;I am hoping to 
know what you mean to do for your dear brother&rsquo;s dear orphans,&rsquo;
and her handkerchief went up to her eyes.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I hope at any rate to give Herbert the education of a gentleman, 
and to send his sisters to good schools.&nbsp; How are they getting 
on?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dear Ida, she is that clever and superior that a master in music 
and French is all she would want.&nbsp; Besides, you know, she is that 
delicate.&nbsp; Connie is the bookish one; she is so eager about the 
examination that she will go on at her school; though I <!-- page 43--><a 
name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 43</span>would have taken her 
away from such a low place at once.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is a good school, and will have given her a good 
foundation.&nbsp; I must see what may be best for them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And, of course, you will put us in a situation becoming the 
family of your dear brother,&rsquo; she added, with another application of 
the handkerchief.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I mean to do what I can, you may be sure, but at present it is 
impossible to name any amount.&nbsp; I neither know what income is coming 
to me, nor what will be my expenses.&nbsp; I meant to come and see you as 
soon as there was anything explicit to tell you; but of course this first 
year there will be much less in hand than later.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; she said, pouting, &lsquo;I can put up with 
something less in the meantime, for of course your poor dear 
brother&rsquo;s widow and children are your first consideration, and even a
nobleman as a bachelor cannot have so many expenses.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I shall not long continue a bachelor,&rsquo; was the answer, 
given with a sort of shy resolution.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, Lord Northmoor!&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t mean to say that you 
intend to go on with that ridiculous affair; when, if you marry at all, it 
ought to be one who will bring something handsome into the 
family.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Once for all, Emma, I will hear no more on that subject.&nbsp; A 
twenty years&rsquo; engagement is not lightly to be broken.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A wretched little teacher,&rsquo; she began, but she was cut 
short.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Remember, I will hear no more of this, and&rsquo; (nothing but 
despair of other means could have <!-- page 44--><a name="page44"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 44</span>inspired him) &lsquo;it is for your own 
interest to abstain from insulting my future wife and myself by such 
remonstrances.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Even then she muttered, &lsquo;Very hard!&nbsp; Not even 
good-looking.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That is as one may think,&rsquo; said he, mentally contrasting 
the flaunting, hardened complexion before him with the sweet countenance he
had never perceived to be pinched or faded; and as he heard something 
between a scornful sniff and a sob, he added, &lsquo;I am wanted in the 
office, so, if you have no more to say of any consequence, I must leave 
you, and Hannah shall give you some tea.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, oh, that you should leave your poor brother&rsquo;s widow in 
this way!&rsquo; and she melted into tears and sobs.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I can&rsquo;t help it, Emma,&rsquo; he said, distressed and 
perplexed.&nbsp; &lsquo;They want me about some business of Mr. 
Claughton&rsquo;s, and I can&rsquo;t keep them waiting.&nbsp; These are 
office hours, you know.&nbsp; Have some tea, and I will come to you 
again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But Mrs. Emma swallowed her sobs as soon as he was gone, and instead of 
waiting for the tea, set forth for Miss Lang&rsquo;s.&nbsp; On asking for 
Miss Marshall she was shown into the drawing-room, where, after she had 
waited a few minutes, nursing her wrath to keep it warm, the small figure 
appeared, whom she had no hesitation in accosting thus&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, Miss Marshall, do I understand that you are resolved to 
attempt thrusting yourself on his Lordship, Lord Northmoor&rsquo;s 
family?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mary, entirely taken by surprise, could only falter, &lsquo;I can only 
do whatever he wishes.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 45--><a name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
45</span>&lsquo;That is just a mere pretence.&nbsp; I wonder you are not 
ashamed to play on his honourable feelings, when you know everything is 
changed, and that it is absolutely ridiculous and derogatory for a peer of 
the realm to stoop to a mere drudge of a teacher.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is,&rsquo; owned Mary; but she went back to her formulary, 
&lsquo;it must be as he wishes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If he is infatuated enough to pretend to wish it, I tell you it 
is your simple duty to refuse him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Whatever might be Mary&rsquo;s own views of her duty, to have it 
inculcated in such a manner stirred her whole soul into opposition, which 
was shown, not in words, but in a tiny curve of the lips, such as 
infuriated her visitor, so that vulgarity and violence were under no 
restraint, and whether all self-command was lost in passion, or whether 
there was an idea that bullying might gain the day, Mrs. Morton&rsquo;s 
voice rose into a shrill scream as she denounced the nasty, mean-spirited 
viper, worming herself&mdash;</p>
<p>The folding doors suddenly opened and in a dignified tone Miss Lang 
announced, &lsquo;Lady Kenton wishes to be introduced to you, Miss 
Marshall.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mary made her little formal bend as well as her trembling limbs would 
allow her.&nbsp; Her cheeks were hot, her eyes swam, her hand shook as Lady
Kenton took it kindly, while Mrs. Morton, too strong in her own convictions
to perceive how the land lay, exclaimed, &lsquo;Your Ladyship is come for 
the same purpose as me, to let Miss Marshall know how detrimental and 
improper it is in her to persist in holding my brother, Lord Northmoor, to 
the unfortunate engagement she inveigled him into.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 46--><a name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 46</span>To
utter this with moderate coolness cost such an effort that she thought Mr. 
Rollstone could not have done it better, and was astonished when Lady 
Kenton replied, &lsquo;Indeed, I came to have the pleasure of 
congratulating Miss Marshall on, if it be not impertinent to say so, a 
beautiful and rare perseverance and constancy being rewarded.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;As if she had not known what she was about,&rsquo; muttered Mrs. 
Morton, not even yet quite confounded, but as she saw the lady lay another 
hand over that of still trembling Mary, she added, &lsquo;Well, if that is 
the case, my lady, and she is to be encouraged in her obstinacy, I have no 
more to say, except that it is a cruel shame on his poor dear 
brother&rsquo;s children, that&mdash;that he has made so much of, and have 
the best right&mdash;&rsquo; and she began to sob again.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Come,&rsquo; said Miss Lang, as if talking to a naughty girl, 
&lsquo;if you are overcome like that, you had better come away.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Wherewith authoritative habits made it possible to her to get Mrs. 
Morton out of the room; while Mary, well used to self-restraint, was 
struggling with choking tears, but when warm-hearted Lady Kenton drew her 
close and kissed her, they began to flow uncontrollably, so that she could 
only gasp, &lsquo;Oh, I beg your pardon, my lady!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Never mind,&rsquo; was the answer; &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t 
wonder!&nbsp; There&rsquo;s no word for that language but 
brutal.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t,&rsquo; was Mary&rsquo;s cry.&nbsp; &lsquo;She is
<i>his</i>, Lord Northmoor&rsquo;s sister-in-law, and he has done 
everything for her ever since his brother&rsquo;s death.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That is no reason she should speak to you in <!-- page 47--><a 
name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 47</span>that way.&nbsp; I must 
ask you to excuse me, but we could not help hearing, she was so loud, and 
then I felt impelled to break in.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was very very kind!&nbsp; But oh, I wish I knew whether she is
not in the right after all!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am sure Lord Northmoor is deeply attached&mdash;quite in 
earnest,&rsquo; said Lady Kenton, feeling rather as if she was taking a 
liberty.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, I know it would grieve him most dreadfully, if it came to an
end now, dear fellow.&nbsp; I know it would break my heart, too, but never 
mind that, I would go away, out of his reach, and he might get over 
it.&nbsp; Would it not be better than his being always ashamed of an 
inferior, incompetent creature, always dragging after him?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I do not think you can be either, after what my daughter and Miss
Lang have told me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You see, it is not even as if I had been a governess in a private
family, I have always been here.&nbsp; I know nothing about servants, or 
great houses, or society, not so much as our least little girl, who has a 
home.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;May I tell you what I think, my dear,&rsquo; said Lady Kenton, 
greatly touched.&nbsp; &lsquo;You have nothing to unlearn, and there is 
nothing needful to the position but what any person of moderate ability and
good sense can acquire, and I am quite sure that Lord Northmoor would be 
far less happy without you, even in the long-run, besides the distress you 
would cause him now.&nbsp; It is not a brilliant, showy person that he 
needs, but one to understand and make him a real home.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That is what he is always telling me,&rsquo; said Mary, somewhat 
cheered.</p>
<p><!-- page 48--><a name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
48</span>&lsquo;Yes, and he could not help showing where his heart 
is,&rsquo; said the lady.&nbsp; &lsquo;Now the holidays are near, are they 
not?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The 11th of July.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then, if you have no other plans, will you come and stay with 
me?&nbsp; We are very quiet people, but you would have an opportunity of 
understanding something of the kind of life.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, how very kind of you!&nbsp; Nobody has been so good to 
me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I think I can help you in some of the difficulties if you will 
let me,&rsquo; said Lady Kenton, quite convinced herself, and leaving a 
much happier woman than she had found.</p>
<h2><!-- page 49--><a name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
49</span>CHAPTER VIII<br />
SECOND THOUGHTS</h2>
<p>Though Miss Lang was shocked and indignant at Mrs. Morton&rsquo;s 
violence, she was a wise woman, and felt that it would be better tact not 
to let such a person depart without an attempt at pacification; so she did 
her best at dignified soothing, and listened to a good deal of grumbling 
and lamentation.</p>
<p>She contrived, however, to give the impression that as things stood, 
Mrs. Morton would be far wiser to make no more resistance, but to consult 
family peace by accepting Miss Marshall, who, she assured the visitor, was 
a very kind and excellent person, not likely to influence Lord Northmoor 
against his own family, except on great provocation.</p>
<p>Mrs. Morton actually yielded so far as to declare she had only spoken 
for her dear brother-in-law&rsquo;s own good, and that since he was so 
infatuated, she supposed, for her dear children&rsquo;s sake, she must 
endure it.&nbsp; Having no desire to encounter him again, she went off by 
the next train, leaving a message that she had had tea at Miss 
Lang&rsquo;s.&nbsp; She <!-- page 50--><a name="page50"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 50</span>related at home to her expectant daughter that 
Lord Northmoor had grown &lsquo;that high and stuck-up, there was no 
speaking to him, and that there Miss Marshall was an artful puss, as knew 
how to play her cards and get <i>in</i> with the quality.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I wish you had taken me, ma,&rsquo; said Ida, &lsquo;I should 
have known what to say to them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I can&rsquo;t tell, child, you might only have made it 
worse.&nbsp; I see how it is now, and we must be mum, or it may be the 
worse for us.&nbsp; He says he will do what he can for us, but I know what 
that means.&nbsp; She will hold the purse-strings, and make him meaner than
he is already.&nbsp; He will never know how to spend his fortune now he has
got it!&nbsp; If your poor, dear pa had only been alive now, he would never
have let you be wronged.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But you gave it to them?&rsquo; cried Ida.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That I did!&nbsp; Only that lady, Lady Kenton, came in all 
stuck-up and haughty, and cut me short, interfering as she had no business 
to, or I would have brought Miss Mary to her marrow-bones.&nbsp; She 
hadn&rsquo;t a word to say for herself, but now she has got those fine 
folks on her side, the thing will go on as sure as fate.&nbsp; However, 
I&rsquo;ve done my dooty, that&rsquo;s one comfort; and now, I suppose I 
shall have to patch it up as best I can.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t!&rsquo; said Ida hotly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, Ida, my dear, you don&rsquo;t know what a mother won&rsquo;t 
do for her children.&rsquo;</p>
<p>A sigh that was often reiterated as Mrs. Morton composed a letter to her
brother-in-law, with some hints from Ida on the spelling, and some from Mr.
Rollstone on the address.&nbsp; The upshot was that her <!-- page 51--><a 
name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 51</span>dear brother and his 
<i>fianc&eacute;e</i> were to believe her actuated by the purest sense of 
the duty and anxiety she owed to them and her dear children, the orphans of
his dear deceased brother.&nbsp; Now that she had once expressed herself, 
she trusted to her dear Frank&rsquo;s affectionate nature to bury all in 
oblivion, and to believe that she should be ready to welcome her new 
sister-in-law with the warmest affection.&nbsp; Therewith followed a 
request for five pounds, to pay for her mourning and darling Ida&rsquo;s, 
which they had felt due to him!</p>
<p>Lord Northmoor did not quite see how it was due to him, nor did he 
intend to give whatever his dear sister-in-law might demand, but she had 
made him so angry that he felt that he must prove his forgiveness to 
himself.&nbsp; Mary had not thought it needful to describe the force of the
attack upon herself, or perhaps his pardon might not have gone so 
far.&nbsp; He sent the note, and added that as he was wanted at Northmoor 
for a day or two, he would take his nephew Herbert with him.</p>
<p>This was something like, as Mrs. Morton said, a kind of tangible 
acknowledgment of their relationship and of Herbert as his heir, and it was
a magnificent thing to tell all her acquaintances that her son was gone to 
the family seat with his uncle, Lord Northmoor.&nbsp; She would fain have 
obtained for him some instructions in the manners of the upper ten thousand
from Mr. Rollstone, but Herbert entirely repudiated listening to that old 
fogey, observing that after all it was only old Frank, and he wasn&rsquo;t 
going to bother himself for the like of him.</p>
<p><!-- page 52--><a name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
52</span>The uncle was fond of his brother&rsquo;s boy, and had devised 
this plan partly for the sake of the pleasure it would give, and partly 
because it was impossible to form any judgment of his character while with 
the mother.&nbsp; He was a fine, well-grown, manly boy, and when seen among
his companions, had an indefinable air of good blood about him.&nbsp; He 
had hitherto been at a good day-school which prepared boys for the merchant
service, and his tastes were so much in the direction of the sea, that it 
was much to be regretted that at fourteen and a half it was useless to 
think of preparation for a naval cadetship.&nbsp; He was sent up by train 
to join his uncle at Hurminster, and the first question after the greeting 
was, &lsquo;I say, uncle, shan&rsquo;t you have a yacht?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I could not afford it, if I wished it,&rsquo; was the answer, 
while <i>Punch</i> was handed over to him, and Lord Northmoor applied 
himself to a long blue letter.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Landlubber!&rsquo; sighed Herbert to himself, with true marine 
contempt for a man who had sat on an office-stool all his life.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;He doesn&rsquo;t look a bit more of a swell than he used to.&nbsp; 
It is well there&rsquo;s some one with some pluck in the family.&rsquo;</p>
<h2><!-- page 53--><a name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
53</span>CHAPTER IX<br />
THE HEIR-PRESUMPTUOUS</h2>
<p>Herbert began to be impressed when, on the train arriving at a little 
country station, a servant in mourning, with finger to his hat, inquired 
after his Lordship&rsquo;s luggage, and another was seen presiding over a 
coroneted brougham.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I say,&rsquo; he breathed forth, when they were shut in, 
&lsquo;is this yours?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is Miss Morton&rsquo;s, I believe, at present.&nbsp; I am to 
arrange whether to keep it or not.&rsquo;</p>
<p>They were driving over an open heath in its summer carpet-like state of 
purple heather, dwarf gorse, and bracken.&nbsp; Lord Northmoor looked out, 
with thoughtfulness in his face.&nbsp; By and by there was a gate, a lodge,
a curtseying woman, and as they passed it, he said, &lsquo;Now, this is 
Northmoor.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yours, uncle?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My&mdash;!&rsquo; was all Herbert could utter.&nbsp; It semed to 
his town-bred eyes a huge space before they reached, through some rather 
scanty plantations, another lodge, and a park, not very extensive, but <!--
page 54--><a name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 54</span>with a few
fine trees, and they thundered up beneath the pillars to what was, to his 
idea, a palace&mdash;with servants standing about in a great hall.</p>
<p>His uncle would have turned one way, but a servant said, &lsquo;Miss 
Morton is in the morning-room, my Lord,&rsquo; and ushered them into a room
where a lady in black came forward.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You did not expect to find me here still,&rsquo; she said 
cordially; &lsquo;but Adela is gone to her brother&rsquo;s, and I thought I
had better stay for the division of&mdash;of the things.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, certainly&mdash;I am&mdash;glad,&rsquo; he stammered, with a 
blush as one not quite sure of the correctness of the proceeding.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t have intruded&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Bosh!&nbsp; I&rsquo;m the intruder.&nbsp; Letitia Bury is 
gone&mdash;alas&mdash;but,&rsquo; said she, laughing, &lsquo;Hailes is 
here&mdash;staying,&rsquo; she added to relieve him and to lessen the 
confusion that amused her, &lsquo;and I see you have a companion.&nbsp; 
Your nephew&mdash;?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, Herbert, my late brother&rsquo;s son.&nbsp; I would not have
brought him if I had known.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A cousin,&rsquo; she said, smiling, and shaking hands with 
him.&nbsp; &lsquo;Boys are my delight.&nbsp; This is quite a new 
experience.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Herbert looked up surprised, not much liking to become an 
experience.&nbsp; He had had less intercourse with ladies than many boys of
humbler pretensions, for his mother had always scouted the idea of sending 
her children to a Sunday-school, and she was neither like his 
mother&rsquo;s friends nor his preconceived notions.&nbsp; &lsquo;There! 
for want of an introduction, I must introduce myself.&nbsp; Your cousin 
Bertha, or Birdie, whichever you like best.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 55--><a name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
55</span>Frank was by no means prepared to say even Bertha, and was in 
agonies lest Herbert should presume on the liberty given him; but if the 
boy had been in the palace of Truth, he would have said, &lsquo;You old 
girl, you are awfully old to call yourself Birdie!&rsquo;&nbsp; For Birdie 
had been a pet name of Rose Rollstone; and Bertha Morton, though slim and 
curly-headed, had a worn look about her eyes, and a countenance such as to 
show her five-and-thirty years, and to the eyes of fourteen was almost 
antediluvian; indeed, older observers might detect a worn, haggard, 
strained look.&nbsp; He was somewhat disgusted, too, at the thin rolls of 
bread-and-butter on the low table, whence she proceeded to hand teacups, as
he thought of the substantial meals at home.&nbsp; When they had been 
conducted to their rooms, and his uncle followed to his, he broke out with 
his perpetual, &lsquo;I say, uncle, is this all the grub great swells 
have?&nbsp; I&rsquo;m awfully peckish!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s early tea, my boy,&rsquo; was the answer, with a 
smile.&nbsp; &lsquo;There&rsquo;s dinner to come, and I hope you will 
behave yourself well, and not use such expressions.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dinner! that&rsquo;s not such a bad hearing, but I suppose one 
must eat it like a judge?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Certainly; I am afraid I am not a very good model, but 
don&rsquo;t you do anything you don&rsquo;t see me do.&nbsp; And, Herbert, 
don&rsquo;t take wine every time the servants offer it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>At which Herbert made a face.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Have you got any evening shoes?&nbsp; No!&nbsp; If I had only 
known that the lady was here!&nbsp; It can&rsquo;t be helped to-day, only 
wash your face and hands well; there&rsquo;s some hot water.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 56--><a name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
56</span>&lsquo;Why, they ain&rsquo;t dirty,&rsquo; said the boy, surveying
them as one to whom the remains of a journey were mere trifles, then, with 
a sigh, &lsquo;It&rsquo;s no end of a place, but you swells have a lot of 
bores, and no mistake!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Upstairs Herbert roamed about studying with great curiosity the 
appliances of the first bedchamber he had ever beheld beyond the degree of 
his mother&rsquo;s &lsquo;first floor,&rsquo; but downstairs, he was in the
mood of the savage, too proud to show wonder or admiration or the sense of 
awe with which he was inspired by being waited on by the very marrow of Mr.
Rollstone, always such grand company at home.&nbsp; This daunted him far 
more than the presence of the lady, and though his was a spirit not easily 
daunted, he almost blushed when that personage peremptorily resisted his 
endeavour to present the wrong glass for champagne, which fortunately he 
disliked too much at the first taste to make another attempt.&nbsp; Lord 
Northmoor, for the first time at the foot of his own table, was on thorns 
all the time, lest he should see his nephew commit some indiscretion, and 
left most of the conversation to Miss Morton and Mr. Hailes, the solicitor,
a fine-looking old gentleman, who was almost fatherly to her, very civil to
him, but who cast somewhat critical eyes on the cub who might have to be 
licked into a shape befitting the heir.</p>
<p>They tried to keep their host in the conversation, but without much 
success, though he listened as it drifted into immediate interests and 
affairs of the neighbourhood, and made response, as best he could, to the 
explanations which, like well-bred people, <!-- page 57--><a 
name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 57</span>they from time to time 
directed to him.&nbsp; He thus learnt that Lady Adela with her little Amice
had been carried off &lsquo;by main force,&rsquo; Bertha said, &lsquo;by 
her brother.&nbsp; But she will come back again,&rsquo; she added.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;She is devoted to the place and her graves&mdash;and the poor 
people.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I do not know what they would do without her,&rsquo; said Mr. 
Hailes.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No.&nbsp; She is lady-of-all-work and Pro-parsoness&mdash;with 
all her might&rsquo;; then seeing, or thinking she saw, a puzzled look, she
added, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know if you discovered, Northmoor, that our 
Vicar, Mr. Woodman, has no wife, and Adela has supplied the lack to the 
parish, having a soul for country poor, whereas they are too tame for 
me.&nbsp; I care about my neighbours, of course, after a sort, but the 
jolly city sparrows of the slums for me!&nbsp; I long to be 
away.&rsquo;</p>
<p>What to say to this Lord Northmoor knew as little as did his nephew, and
with some difficulty he managed to utter, &lsquo;Are not they very 
uncivilised?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s the beauty of it,&rsquo; said Bertha; 
&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve spotted my own special preserve of match-girls, newsboys,
etc., and Mr. Hailes is going to help me to get a scrumptious little house,
whence I can get to it by underground rail.&nbsp; Oh, you may shake your 
head, Mr. Hailes, but if you will not help me, I shall set my unassisted 
genius to work, and you&rsquo;ll only suffer agonies in thinking of the 
muddle I may be making.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What does Lady Adela say?&rsquo; asked Mr. Hailes.</p>
<p>&lsquo;She thinks me old enough to take care of myself, <!-- page 
58--><a name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 58</span>whatever you 
do, Mr. Hailes; besides, she knows I can come up to breathe!&nbsp; I long 
for it!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The dinner ended by Bertha rising, and proposing to Herbert to come with
her.&nbsp; It was not too dark, she said, to look out into the Park and see
the rabbits scudding about.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; said Mr. Hailes, shaking his head as they went, 
&lsquo;the rabbits ought not to be so near, but there has been sad neglect 
since poor Mr. Morton&rsquo;s death.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was much easier to get on in a <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i>,
and before long Mr. Hailes had heard some of the perplexities about 
Herbert, the foremost of which was how to make him presentable for 
ladies&rsquo; society in the evening.&nbsp; If Miss Morton&rsquo;s presence
had been anticipated, either his uncle would not have brought him, or would
have fitted him out beforehand, for though he looked fit for the fields and
woods in male company, evening costume had not yet dawned on his 
imagination.&nbsp; Mr. Hailes recommended sending him in the morning to the
town at Colbeam, under charge of the butler, Prowse&mdash;who would rather 
enjoy the commission, and was quite capable of keeping up any needed 
authority.&nbsp; For the future training, the more important matter on 
which he was next consulted, Mr. Hailes mentioned the name of a private 
tutor, who was likely to be able to deal with the boy better under present 
circumstances than a public school could do&mdash;since at Herbert&rsquo;s 
age, his ignorance of the classics on the one hand, and of gentlemanly 
habits on the other, would tell too much against him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But,&rsquo; said Mr. Hailes, &lsquo;Miss Morton will be a very 
good adviser to you on that head.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 59--><a name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
59</span>&lsquo;She is very good-natured to him,&rsquo; said Frank.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No one living has a better heart than Miss Morton,&rsquo; said 
Mr. Hailes heartily; &lsquo;a little eccentric, owing to&mdash;to 
circumstances.&nbsp; She has had her troubles, poor dear; but she has as 
good a heart as ever was, as you will find, my Lord, in all arrangements 
with her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Lord Northmoor&rsquo;s feelings towards her might be 
startled the next morning, when he descended to the dining-room.&nbsp; A 
screen cut off the door, and as he was coming round it, followed by his 
nephew, Bertha&rsquo;s clear voice was heard saying, &lsquo;Yes, he is 
inoffensive, but he is a stick.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s no denying it, Mr. 
Hailes, he is a dreadful stick.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Frank was too far advanced to retire, before the meaning dawned on him, 
partly through a little explosion of Herbert behind him, and partly from 
the guilty consternation and colour with which the other two turned round 
from the erection of plants among which they were standing.</p>
<p>Yet it was the shy man who spoke first in the predicament, like a timid 
creature driven to bay.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, Miss Morton, I know it is too true; no one is more sensible 
of it than myself.&nbsp; I can only hope to do my best, such as it 
is.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, Northmoor, it was very horrid and unguarded in me, and I can 
only be sorry and beg your pardon,&rsquo; and while she laughed and held 
out her hand, there was a dew in her eyes.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Truths do not need pardon,&rsquo; he said, as he gave a cousinly 
grasp, &lsquo;and I think you will try kindly to excuse my deficiencies and
disadvantages.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 60--><a name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
60</span>There was a certain dignity in his tone, and Bertha said 
heartily&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank you.&nbsp; It is all right in essentials, and chatter is of
very little consequence.&nbsp; Now come and have some breakfast.&rsquo;</p>
<p>They got on together far better after that, and began to feel like 
relations, before Herbert was sent off with Mr. Prowse to Colbeam.&nbsp; 
Indeed, throughout the transactions that followed, Bertha showed herself 
far less devoted to her own interests than to what might be called the 
honour of the family.&nbsp; Her father&rsquo;s will had been made in haste,
after the death of his little grandson, and was as concise as possible, her
influence having told upon it.&nbsp; Knowing that the new heir would have 
nothing to begin with, and aware that if he inherited merely the title, 
house, and land, he would be in great straits, the old Lord had bequeathed 
to him nearly what would have been left to the grandson, a fair proportion 
of the money in the funds and bank, and all the furniture and appurtenances
of Northmoor House, excepting such articles as Bertha and Lady Adela might 
select, each up to a certain value.</p>
<p>Lady Adela&rsquo;s had been few, and already chosen, and Bertha&rsquo;s 
were manifestly only matters of personal belonging, and not up altogether 
to the amount named; so as to avoid stripping the place, which, at the 
best, was only splendid in utterly unaccustomed eyes.&nbsp; Horses and 
carriages had to be bought of her, and it was she who told him what was 
absolutely necessary, and fixed the price as low as she could, so as not to
make them a gift.&nbsp; And he was not so ignorant in this matter as she 
had <!-- page 61--><a name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
61</span>expected&mdash;for the old habits of his boyhood served him, he 
could ride well, and his scruples at Miss Morton&rsquo;s estimate proved 
that he knew a horse when he saw it&mdash;as she said.&nbsp; She would, 
perhaps, have liked him better if he had been a dissipated horsey man like 
his father.&nbsp; He would have given her sensations&mdash;and on his side,
considering the reputation of the family, he was surprised at her eager, 
almost passionate desire to be rid of the valuable horses and equipages as 
soon as possible.</p>
<p>When, in the afternoon, she went out of doors to refresh herself with a 
solitary ramble in the Park after her morning of business, she heard an 
altercation, and presently encountered a keeper, dragging after him a 
trespasser, in whom, to her amazement, she recognised Herbert Morton, at 
the same moment as he exclaimed: &lsquo;Cousin Bertha!&nbsp; 
Miss&mdash;&nbsp; Look at this impudent fellow, though I told him I was 
Lord Northmoor&rsquo;s own nephew.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And I told him, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; said the keeper, touching his
hat, &lsquo;that if he was ten nephews I wouldn&rsquo;t have him throwing 
stones at my pheasants, nor his Lordship wouldn&rsquo;t neither, and then 
he sauced me, and I said I would see what his Lordship said to 
that.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You must excuse him this time, Best,&rsquo; said Miss Morton; 
&lsquo;he is a town-bred boy, and knows no better, and you had better not 
worry his Lordship about it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very well, Miss Morton, if it is your pleasure, but them 
pheasants are my province, and I must do my dooty.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of course, quite right, Best,&rsquo; she answered; &lsquo;but 
<!-- page 62--><a name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 62</span>my 
cousin here did not understand, and you must make allowance for 
him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Best touched his hat again, and went off with an undercurrent of 
growl.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, Herbert, this is a pity!&rsquo; Miss Morton exclaimed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Cheeky chap!&rsquo; said Herbert sulkily.&nbsp; &lsquo;What 
business had he to meddle with me?&nbsp; A great big wild bird gets up with
no end of a row, and I did nothing but shy a stone, and out comes this 
fellow at me in a regular wax, and didn&rsquo;t care half a farthing when I
told him who I was.&nbsp; I fancy he did not believe me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t wonder,&rsquo; said Bertha; &lsquo;you have yet to 
learn that in the eyes of any gentleman, nothing is much more sacred than a
pheasant.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I never meant to hurt the thing, only one just chucks a 
stone,&rsquo; muttered Herbert, abashed, but still defensive and 
offended.&nbsp; &lsquo;I thought my uncle would teach the rascal how to 
speak to me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what, Herbert, if you take that line with 
good old servants, who are only doing their duty, you won&rsquo;t have a 
happy time of it here.&nbsp; I suppose you wish to take your place as a 
gentleman.&nbsp; Well, the greatest sign of a gentleman is to be courteous 
and well-behaved to all about him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He wasn&rsquo;t courteous or well-behaved to me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, because you did not show yourself such a gentleman as he has 
been used to.&nbsp; If you acted like a tramp or a poacher, no wonder he 
thought you one&rsquo;; then, after a pause, &lsquo;You will find that much
of your pleasure in sport depends on the keepers, and that it would be a 
great disadvantage <!-- page 63--><a name="page63"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 63</span>to be on bad terms with them, so I strongly 
advise you, on every account, to treat them with civility, and put out of 
your head that there is any dignity in being rude.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Herbert liked Miss Morton, and had been impressed as well as kindly 
treated by her, and though he sulked now, there was an after-effect.</p>
<h2><!-- page 64--><a name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
64</span>CHAPTER X<br />
COMING HONOURS</h2>
<p>With great trepidation did Mary Marshall set forth on her visit to Coles
Kenton.&nbsp; She had made up her mind&mdash;and a determined mind it could
be on occasion&mdash;that on it should turn her final acceptance of her 
twenty years&rsquo; lover.</p>
<p>Utterly inexperienced as she was, even in domestic, not to say high 
life, she had perhaps an exaggerated idea, alike of its requirements and of
her own deficiencies; and she was resolved to use her own judgment, 
according to her personal experience, whether she should be hindrance or 
help to him whom she loved too truly and unselfishly to allow herself to be
made the former.</p>
<p>She was glad that for the first few days she should not see him, and 
should thus be less distracted and biased, but it was with a sinking heart 
that she heard that Lady Kenton had called to take her up in the 
carriage.&nbsp; Grateful as she was for the kindness, which saved her the 
dreariness of a solitary arrival, she was a strange mixture of resolution 
and self-distrust, of moral courage and timidity, as had <!-- page 65--><a 
name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 65</span>been shown by her 
withstanding all Miss Lang&rsquo;s endeavours to make her improve her dress
beyond what was absolutely necessary for the visit, lest it should be 
presuming on the future.</p>
<p>Lady Kenton had a manner such as to smooth away shyness, and, with tact 
that perceived with what kind of nature she had to deal, managed to make 
the tea-table serve only as a renewal of acquaintance with Frederica, and 
an introduction to Sir Edward, after which Mary was taken to the schoolroom
and made known to the governess, a kindly, sensible woman, who, according 
to previous arrangement, made the visitor free of her domains as a 
refuge.</p>
<p>The prettiness and luxury of the guest-chamber was quite a shock, and 
Mary would rather have faced a dozen naughty girls than have taken Sir 
Edward&rsquo;s arm to go in to dinner.&nbsp; However, her hostess had 
decided on a quiet course of treatment such as not to frighten this pupil, 
and it had been agreed only to take enough notice of her to prevent her 
from feeling herself neglected, until she should begin to be more at 
ease.&nbsp; Nor was it long before a certain sparkle in the brown eyes 
showed that she was amused by, and appreciative of, the family talk.</p>
<p>It was true, as Lady Kenton had told her, that she had nothing to 
unlearn, all she wanted was confidence, experience, and ease, and in so 
humble, gentle, and refined a nature as hers, the acquisition of these 
could not lead to the disclosure of anything undesirable.&nbsp; So, after 
the first day of novelty, when she had learnt the hours, could distinguish 
between the young people, knew her way about the house so <!-- page 66--><a
name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 66</span>as to be secure of not 
opening the wrong doors, and when she had learnt where and when she would 
be welcome and even helpful, she began to enjoy herself and the life, the 
beauty, and the leisure.</p>
<p>She made friends heartily with the governess, fraternised with Freda, 
taught the younger girls new games, could hold a sort of conversation with 
Sir Edward, became less afraid of George, and daily had more of filial 
devotion to Lady Kenton.&nbsp; The books on the tables were a real delight 
and pleasure to her, when she found that it was not ill-mannered to sit 
down and read in the forenoon, and the discussion of them was a great help 
in what Freda called teaching her to talk.&nbsp; Visitors were very 
gradually brought upon her, a gentleman or two at first, who knew nothing 
about her, perhaps thought her the governess and merely bowed to her.&nbsp;
There was only one real <i>contretemps</i>, when some guests, who lived 
rather beyond the neighbourhood, arrived for afternoon tea, and, moreover, 
full of curiosity about Lord Northmoor.&nbsp; Was it true that he was an 
attorney&rsquo;s clerk, and was not he going to marry a very inferior 
person?</p>
<p>&lsquo;Certainly not,&rsquo; said Lady Kenton.&nbsp; &lsquo;He is 
engaged to my friend, Miss Marshall.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The said Miss Marshall was handing the sugar, while Freda was pouring 
out the tea.&nbsp; She had been named on the ladies&rsquo; entrance, and 
the colour rose to her eyes but she said nothing, while there was a 
confusion of, &lsquo;I beg pardon.&nbsp; I understand.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Report makes a good many mistakes,&rsquo; said Lady Kenton 
coolly.&nbsp; &lsquo;Mary, my dear, you have given me no sugar.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was the first time of calling her by her <!-- page 67--><a 
name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 67</span>Christian name, and 
done for the sake of making the equal intimacy apparent.&nbsp; In fact, 
Mary was behaving herself better than the visitors, as Lady Kenton 
absolutely told her when a sort of titter was heard in the hall, where they
were expressing to Freda their horror at the scrape, and extorting that 
Miss Marshall was really a governess.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But quite a lady,&rsquo; said Freda stoutly, &lsquo;and we are 
all as fond of her as possible.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It showed how much progress she had made that even this shock did not 
set her to express any more faint-hearted doubts, and, when Lord Northmoor 
arrived the next day, the involuntary radiance on both their faces was 
token enough that they were all the world to each other.&nbsp; Mary allowed
herself to venture on getting Lady Kenton&rsquo;s counsel on the duties of 
household headship that would fall on her; and instead of being terrified 
at the great garden-party and dinner-party to be held at Coles Kenton, 
eagerly availed herself of instruction in the details of their 
management.&nbsp; She had accepted her fate, and when the two were seen 
moving about among the people of the party they neither of them looked 
incongruous with the county aristocracy.&nbsp; Quiet, retiring, and 
insignificant they might be, but there was nothing to remark by the most 
curious eyes of those who knew they were to see the new peer and his 
destined bride; in fact, as George and Freda privately remarked, they were 
just the people that nobody ever would see at all, unless they were set up 
upon a pedestal.</p>
<p>Mary still feebly suggested, when the marriage was spoken of, that it 
might be wiser for Frank to <!-- page 68--><a name="page68"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 68</span>wait a year, get over his first expenses and 
feel his way; but he would not hear of her going back to her work, and 
pleaded his solitude so piteously that she could not but consent to let it 
take place as soon as possible.&nbsp; They would fain have kept it as 
private as possible, but their good friends were of opinion that it was 
necessary to give them a start with some <i>&eacute;clat</i>, and insisted 
that it should take place with all due honours at Coles Kenton, where Mary 
was treated like a favoured niece, and assisted with counsel on her 
<i>trousseau</i>.&nbsp; The savings she had made during the long years of 
her engagement were enough to fit her out sufficiently to feel that she was
bringing her own wardrobe, and Lady Kenton actually went to London with her
to superintend the outlay.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Whom would they like to have asked to the wedding?&rsquo; the 
lady inquired, herself naming the Langs and Burfords.&nbsp; &lsquo;Of 
course,&rsquo; she added, smiling, &lsquo;Freda and Alice will be only too 
happy to be bridesmaids.&nbsp; Have you any one whom you would wish to 
ask?&nbsp; Your old scholars perhaps.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I think,&rsquo; said Mary, hesitating, &lsquo;that one reason why
we think we ought to decline your kindness was&mdash;about <i>his</i> 
relations.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Lady Kenton had given full license to the propriety of calling 
<i>him</i> Frank with intimate friends, but Mary always had a shyness about
it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Indeed, I should make no question about asking them, if I had not
doubted whether, after what passed&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That is all forgotten,&rsquo; said Mary gently.&nbsp; &lsquo;I 
have had quite a nice letter since, and&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 69--><a name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
69</span>&lsquo;Of course they must be asked,&rsquo; said Lady Kenton; 
&lsquo;I should have proposed it before, but for that scene.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That is nothing,&rsquo; said Mary; &lsquo;the doubt is whether, 
considering the style of people, it would not be better for us to manage it
otherwise, and not let you be troubled.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s nothing!&nbsp; On such an occasion there&rsquo;s
no fear of their not behaving like the rest of the world.&nbsp; There are 
girls, I think; they should be bridesmaids.&rsquo;</p>
<p>This very real kindness overcame all scruples, and indeed a great deal 
might be forgiven to Miss Marshall in consideration of the glory of telling
all Westhaven of the invitation to be present &lsquo;at my brother Lord 
Northmoor&rsquo;s wedding, at Sir Edward Kenton&rsquo;s, 
Baronet.&rsquo;&nbsp; He gave the dresses, not only the bridesmaids&rsquo; 
white and cerise (Freda&rsquo;s choice), but the chocolate moir&eacute; 
which for a minute Mrs. Morton fancied &lsquo;the little spiteful 
cat&rsquo; had chosen on purpose to suppress her, till assured by all 
qualified beholders, especially Mrs. Rollstone and a dressmaker friend, 
that in nothing else would she have looked so entirely quite the lady.</p>
<p>And Lady Kenton&rsquo;s augury was fulfilled.&nbsp; The whole family 
were subdued enough by their surroundings to comport themselves quite well 
enough to pass muster.</p>
<h2><!-- page 70--><a name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
70</span>CHAPTER XI<br />
POSSESSION</h2>
<p>So Francis Morton, Baron Northmoor of Northmoor, and Mary Marshall, 
daughter of the late Reverend John Marshall, were man and wife at 
last.&nbsp; Their honeymoon was ideally happy.&nbsp; It fulfilled a dream 
of their life, when Frank used, in the holidays spent by Mary with his 
mother, to read aloud the Waverley novels, and they had calculated, almost 
as an impossible castle in the air, the possibility of visiting the 
localities.&nbsp; And now they went, as assuredly they had never thought of
going, and not much impeded by the greatness that had been thrust on 
them.&nbsp; The good-natured Kentons had dispensed his Lordship from the 
encumbrance of a valet, and though my Lady could not well be allowed to go 
maidless, Lady Kenton had found a sensible, friendly person for her, of 
whom she soon ceased to be afraid, and thus felt the advantage of being 
able to attend to her husband instead of her luggage.</p>
<p>Tourists might look and laugh at their simple delight as at that of a 
pair of unsophisticated cockneys.&nbsp; This did not trouble them, as they 
trod <!-- page 71--><a name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
71</span>what was to them classic ground, tried in vain the impossible feat
of &lsquo;seeing Melrose aright,&rsquo; but revelled in what they did see, 
stood with bated breath at Dryburgh by the Minstrel&rsquo;s tomb, and 
tracked his magic spells from the Tweed even to Staffa, feeling the full 
delight for the first time of mountain, sea, and loch.&nbsp; Their 
enjoyment was perhaps even greater than that of boy and girl, for it was 
the reaction of chastened lives and hearts &lsquo;at leisure from 
themselves,&rsquo; nor were spirit and vigour too much spent for 
enterprise.</p>
<p>They tasted to the full every innocent charm that came in their way, 
and, above all, the bliss of being together in the perfect sympathy that 
had been the growth of so many years.&nbsp; Their maid, Harte, might well 
confide to her congeners that though my lord and my lady were the oldest 
couple she had known, they were the most attached, in a quiet way.</p>
<p>They were loth to end this state of felicity before taking their new 
cares upon them, and were glad that the arrangements of the executors made 
it desirable that they should not take possession till October, when they 
left behind them the gorgeous autumn beauty of the western coast and 
journeyed southwards.</p>
<p>The bells were rung, the gates thrown wide open, and lights flashed in 
the windows as Lord and Lady Northmoor drove up to their home, but it was 
in the dark, and there was no demonstrative welcome, the indoor servants 
were all new, the cook-housekeeper hired by Lady Kenton&rsquo;s assistance,
and the rest of the maids chosen by her, the butler and his subordinate 
acquired in like manner.</p>
<p><!-- page 72--><a name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 72</span>It
was a little dreary.&nbsp; The rooms looked large and empty.&nbsp; Miss 
Morton&rsquo;s belongings had been just what gave a homelike air to the 
place, and when these were gone, even the big fires could not greatly cheer
the huge spaces.&nbsp; However, these two months had accustomed the new 
arrivals to their titles, and likewise to being waited upon, and they were 
less at a loss than they would have been previously, though to Mary 
especially it was hard to realise that it was her own house, and that she 
need ask no one&rsquo;s leave.&nbsp; Also that it was not a duty to sit 
with a fire.&nbsp; She could not well have done so, considering how many 
were doing their best to enliven the house, and finally she spent the 
evening in the library, not a very inviting room in itself, but which the 
late lord had inhabited, and where the present one had already held 
business interviews.&nbsp; It was, of course, lined with the standard books
of the last generation, and Mary, who had heard of many, but never had 
access to them, flitted over them while her husband opened the letters he 
had found awaiting him.&nbsp; To her, what some one has called the 
&lsquo;tea, tobacco, and snuff&rsquo; of an old library where the books are
chiefly viewed as appropriate furniture, were all delightful 
discoveries.&nbsp; Even to &lsquo;Hume&rsquo;s <i>History of 
England</i>&mdash;nine volumes!&nbsp; I did not know it was so long!&nbsp; 
Our first class had the Student&rsquo;s <i>Hume</i>.&nbsp; Is there much 
difference?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Rather to the Student&rsquo;s advantage, I believe.&nbsp; Half 
these letters, at least, are mere solicitations for custom!&nbsp; And 
advertisements!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How the books stick together!&nbsp; I wonder when they were 
opened last!&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 73--><a name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
73</span>&lsquo;Never, I suspect,&rsquo; said he.&nbsp; &lsquo;I do not 
imagine the Mortons were much disposed to read.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, they have left us a delightful store!&nbsp; What&rsquo;s 
this?&nbsp; Smollett&rsquo;s <i>Don Quixote</i>.&nbsp; I always wanted to 
know about that.&nbsp; Is it not something about giants and 
windmills?&nbsp; Have you read it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I once read an odd volume.&nbsp; He was half mad, and too good 
for this world, and thought he was living in a romance.&nbsp; I will read 
you some bits.&nbsp; You would not like it all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, I do hope you will have time to read to me!&nbsp; 
Gibbon&rsquo;s <i>Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire</i>.&nbsp; All these
volumes!&nbsp; They are quite damp.&nbsp; You have read it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, and I wish I could remember all those Emperors.&nbsp; I must
put aside this letter for Hailes&mdash;it is a man applying for a 
house.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How strange it sounds!&nbsp; Look, here is such an immense 
<i>Shakespeare</i>!&nbsp; Oh! full of engravings,&rsquo; as she fell upon 
Boydell&rsquo;s <i>Shakespeare</i>&mdash;another name reverenced, though 
she only knew a few selected plays, prepared for elocution exercises.</p>
<p>Her husband, having had access to the Institute Library, and spent many 
evenings over books, was better read than she, whose knowledge went no 
farther than that of the highest class, but who knew all very accurately 
that she did know, and was intelligent enough to find in those shelves a 
delightful promise of pasture.&nbsp; He was by this time sighing over 
requests for subscriptions.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Such numbers!&nbsp; Such good purposes!&nbsp; But how can I 
give?&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 74--><a name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
74</span>&lsquo;Cannot you give at least a guinea?&rsquo; asked Mary, after
hearing some.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I do not know whether in this position a small sum in the list is
not more disadvantageous than nothing at all.&nbsp; Besides, I know nothing
of the real merits.&nbsp; I must ask Hailes.&nbsp; Ah! and here is Emma, I 
thought that she would be a little impatient.&nbsp; She says she shall let 
her house for the winter, and thinks of going to London or to Brighton, 
where she may have masters for the girls.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, I thought you meant them to go to a good school?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;So I do, if I can get Emma&rsquo;s consent; but I doubt her 
choosing to part with Ida.&nbsp; She wants to come here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I suppose we ought to have her?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, but not immediately.&nbsp; I do not mean to neglect 
her&mdash;at least, I do hope to do all that is right; but I think you 
ought to have a fair start here before she comes, so that we will invite 
her for Christmas, and then we can arrange about Ida and 
Constance.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dear little Connie, I hope she is as nice a little girl as she 
used to be!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;With good training, I think, she will be; and the tutor gives me 
good accounts of Herbert in this letter.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Shall we have him here on Sunday week?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, I am very anxious to see him.&nbsp; I hope his master gives 
him more religious instruction than he has ever had, poor boy!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Though not brilliant or playful, Lord and Lady Northmoor had, it may be 
perceived, no lack of good <!-- page 75--><a name="page75"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 75</span>sense in their strange new surroundings.&nbsp; 
It was hard not to feel like guests on sufferance, and next morning, a 
Sunday, was wet.&nbsp; However, under their waterproofs and umbrellas 
trudging along, they felt once more, as Mary said, like themselves, as if 
they had escaped from their keepers.&nbsp; Nobody on the way had the least 
idea who the two cloaked figures were, and when they crept into the seat 
nearest the door they were summarily ejected by a fat, red-faced man, who 
growled audibly, &lsquo;You&rsquo;ve no business in my pew!&rsquo;</p>
<p>However, with the words, &lsquo;Beg your pardon,&rsquo; they stepped out
with a little amusement in their eyes, when a spruce young woman sprang up 
from the opposite pew, with a scandalised whisper&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr. Ruddiman, it&rsquo;s his Lordship!&nbsp; Allow me, my 
Lord&mdash;your own seat&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>And she marshalled them up to the choir followed closely by Mr. 
Ruddiman, ruddier than ever, and butcher all over, in a perfect agony of 
apology, which Lord Northmoor in vain endeavoured to suppress or silence, 
till, when the guide had pointed to a handsome heavy carved seat with 
elaborate cushions, he gave a final gasp of, &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll not 
remember it in the custom, my Lord,&rsquo; and departed, leaving his 
Lordship almost equally scarlet with annoyance at the place and time of the
demonstration, though, happily, the clergyman had not yet appeared, in his 
long and much-tumbled surplice.</p>
<p>It was a case of a partial restoration of a church in the dawn of such 
doings, when the horsebox was removed, but the great family could not be 
routed out of the chancel, so there were the seats, where <!-- page 76--><a
name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 76</span>the choir ought to have
sat, beneath a very ugly east window, bedecked with the Morton arms.&nbsp; 
In the other division of the seat was a pale lady in black, with a little 
girl, Lady Adela Morton, no doubt, and opposite were the servants, and the 
school children sat crowded on the steps.&nbsp; It was not such a service 
as had been the custom of the Hurminster churches; and the singing, such as
it was, depended on the thin shrill voices of the children, assisted by 
Lady Adela and the mistress; the sermon was dull and long, and altogether 
there was something disheartening about the whole.</p>
<p>Lady Adela had a gentle, sweet countenance and a simple devout manner; 
but it was disappointing that she did not attempt to address the newcomers,
though they passed her just outside the churchyard, talking to an old 
man.&nbsp; Lady Kenton would surely have welcomed them.</p>
<h2><!-- page 77--><a name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

THE BURTHEN OF HONOURS</h2>
<p>A fearful affair to the new possessors of Northmoor was the matter of 
morning calls.&nbsp; The first that befell them, as in duty bound, was that
from the Vicar.&nbsp; They were peaceably writing their letters in the 
library, and hoping soon to go out to explore the Park, when Mr. Woodman 
was announced, and was found a lonely black speck in the big dreary 
drawing-room, a very state room, indeed, which nobody had ever willingly 
inhabited.&nbsp; The Vicar was accustomed to be overridden; he was an 
elderly widower, left solitary in his old age, and of depressed spirits and
manner.&nbsp; However, Frank had been used to intercourse with clergy, 
though his relations with them seemed reversed, and instead of being 
patronised, he had to take the initiative; or rather, they touched each 
other&rsquo;s cold, shy, limp hands, and sat upright in their chairs, and 
observed upon the appropriate topic of early frosts, which really seemed to
be affecting themselves.</p>
<p>There was a little thaw when Lord Northmoor asked about the population, 
larger, alas, than the <!-- page 78--><a name="page78"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 78</span>congregation might have seemed to show, and 
Mary asked if there were much poverty, and was answered that there was much
suffering in the winter, there was not much done for the poor except by 
Lady Adela.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You must tell us how we can assist in any way.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The poor man began to brighten.&nbsp; &lsquo;It will be a great comfort 
to have some interest in the welfare of the parish taken here, my 
Lord.&nbsp; The influence hitherto has not been fortunate.&nbsp; Miss 
Morton, indeed&mdash;latterly&mdash;but, poor thing, if I may be allowed to
say so, she is flighty&mdash;and uncertain&mdash;no 
wonder&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>At that moment Lady Adela was ushered in, and the Vicar looked as if 
caught in talking treason, while a fresh nip of frost descended on the 
party.</p>
<p>Not that the lady was by any means on stiff terms with the Vicar, whom, 
indeed, she daily consulted on parochial subjects, and she had the 
gracious, hereditary courtesy of high breeding; but she always averred that
this same drawing-room chilled her, and she was fully persuaded that any 
advance towards familiarity would lead to something obnoxious on the part 
of the newcomers, so that the proper relations between herself and them 
could only be preserved by a judicious entrenchment of courtesy.&nbsp; 
Still, it was more the manner of the Vicar than of herself that gave the 
impression of her being a formidable autocrat.&nbsp; After the frost had 
been again languidly discussed, Mr. Woodman faltered out, &lsquo;His 
Lordship was asking&mdash;was so good as to ask&mdash;how to assist in the 
parish.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Lady Adela knew how scarce money must be, <!-- page 79--><a 
name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 79</span>so she hesitated to 
mention subscriptions, and only said, &lsquo;Thank you&mdash;very 
kind.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is there any one I could read to?&rsquo; ventured Mary.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Have you been used to the kind of thing?&rsquo; asked Lady Adela,
not unkindly, but in a doubting tone.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, I never could before; but I do wish to try to do 
something.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The earnest humility of the tone was touching, the Vicar and the 
autocrat looked at one another, and the former suggested, &lsquo;Old 
Swan!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Lady Adela, &lsquo;old Swan lives out at 
Linghill, which is not above half a mile from this house, but too far off 
for me to visit constantly.&nbsp; I shall be very much obliged if you can 
undertake the cottages there.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank you,&rsquo; said Mary, as heartily as if she were receiving
a commission from the Bishop of the diocese.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did not Miss Morton mention something about a boys&rsquo; 
class?&rsquo; said Frank.&nbsp; &lsquo;I have been accustomed to a Sunday 
school.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Woodman betrayed as much surprise as if he had said he was 
accustomed to a coal mine; and Lady Adela observed graciously, &lsquo;Most 
of them have gone into service this Michaelmas; but no doubt it will be a 
relief to Mr. Woodman if you find time to undertake them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>This was the gist of the first two morning calls, and there were many 
more such periods of penance, for the bride and bridegroom were not modern 
enough in their notions to sit up to await their <!-- page 80--><a 
name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 80</span>visitors, and thankful 
they were to those who would be at the expense of finding conversation, 
though this was not always the case; for much of the neighbourhood was of a
description to be awed by the mere fact of a great house, and to take the 
shyness of titled people for pride.&nbsp; Those with whom they prospered 
best were a good-natured, merry old dowager duchess, with whom they felt 
themselves in the altitude to which they were accustomed at Hurminster; a 
loud-voiced, eager old squire, who was bent on being Lord Northmoor&rsquo;s
guide and prompter in county business; also an eager, gushing lady, the 
echoes of whose communications made Frank remark, after her departure, 
&lsquo;We must beware of encouraging gossip about the former 
family.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, I wish I had the power of setting people down when they say 
what is undesirable, like Miss Lang, or Lady Adela!&rsquo; sighed Mary.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Try to think of them like your school girls,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>The returning of the calls was like continually pulling the string of a 
shower-bath, and glad were the sighs when people proved to be not at home; 
but on the whole, being entertained was not half so formidable as 
entertaining, and a bride was not expected to do more than sit in her white
silk, beside the host.</p>
<p>But the return parties were an incubus on their minds.&nbsp; Only they 
were not to be till after Christmas.</p>

THE DOWER HOUSE</h2>
<p>Over the hearth of the drawing-room of the Dower House, in the sociable 
twilight that had descended on the afternoon tea-table, sat three 
ladies&mdash;for Lady Adela and Miss Morton had just welcomed Mrs. Bury, 
who, though she had her headquarters in London, generally spent her time in
visits to her married daughters or expeditions abroad.</p>
<p>Amice had just exhibited her doll, Elmira&rsquo;s last acquisition, a 
little chest of drawers, made of matchboxes and buttons, that Constance 
Morton had taught her to make, and then she had gone off to put the said 
Elmira and her companions to bed, after giving it as her grave opinion that
Lady Northmoor was a great acquisition.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do you think so?&rsquo; said Mrs. Bury, after the laugh at the 
sedate expression.</p>
<p>&lsquo;She is very kind to Amice, and I do not think she will do her any
harm,&rsquo; said Lady Adela.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Governessing was her <i>m&eacute;tier</i>,&rsquo; added Bertha, 
&lsquo;so it is not likely.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And how does it turn out?&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 82--><a name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
82</span>&lsquo;Oh, it might be a good deal worse.&nbsp; I see no reason 
for not living on here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And you, Birdie?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, I <i>couldn&rsquo;t</i>!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve been burning to get
away these seven years, and as Northmoor actually seems capable of taking 
my boys, my last tie is gone.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m only afraid he&rsquo;ll bore 
them with too much Sabbatarianism and temperance.&nbsp; He is just the cut 
of the model Sabbath-school teacher, only he vexes Addie&rsquo;s soul by 
dashes of the Ritualist.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said Mrs. Bury, &lsquo;the excellent Mr. Woodman is 
capable of improvement.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But how?&rsquo; said Lady Adela.&nbsp; &lsquo;Narrow ritualism 
without knowledge or principle is a thing to be deprecated.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is it without knowledge or principle?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How should an attorney&rsquo;s clerk get either?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But I understand you that they are worthy people, and not 
obnoxious.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Worthy!&rsquo; exclaimed Bertha.&nbsp; &lsquo;Yes, worthy to 
their stiff backbones, worthy to the point of utter dulness; they 
haven&rsquo;t got enough vulgarity even to drop their h&rsquo;s or be any 
way entertaining.&nbsp; I should like them ever so much better if they ate 
with their knives and drank out of their saucers, but she can&rsquo;t even 
mispronounce a French word worse than most English people.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No pretension even?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh no; if there were, one could get some fun out of it.&nbsp; I 
have heard of bearing honours meekly, but they don&rsquo;t even do that, 
they just let them hang on them, like the stick and stock they are.&nbsp; 
If I <!-- page 83--><a name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
83</span>were Addie, it would be the deadly liveliness that would drive me 
away.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nay,&rsquo; said Adela; &lsquo;one grows to be content with mere 
negations, if they are nothing worse.&nbsp; I <i>could</i> be driven away, 
or at least find it an effort to remain, if Lady Northmoor were like her 
sister-in-law.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, now, that&rsquo;s just what would make it tolerable to 
me.&nbsp; I could get a rise or two out of that Mrs. Morton.&nbsp; I did 
get her to be confidential and to tell me how much better the honours would
have sat upon her dear husband.&nbsp; I believe she thinks that if he were 
alive he would have shared them like the Spartan kings.&nbsp; She wishes 
that &ldquo;her brother, Lord Northmoor&rdquo; (you should hear the tone), 
&ldquo;were more worldly, and she begs me to impress on him the duty of 
doing everything for her dear Herbert, who, in the nature of things, must 
be the heir to the peerage.&rdquo;&lsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am sure I hope not,&rsquo; said Lady Adela.&nbsp; &lsquo;He is 
an insufferable boy.&nbsp; The people about the place can&rsquo;t endure 
him.&nbsp; He is quite insolent.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The animal, man, when in certain stages of development, has a 
peculiar tendency to be unpleasant,&rsquo; observed Bertha 
philosophically.&nbsp; &lsquo;To my mind, Master Herbert is the most 
promising of the specimens.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Birdie!&nbsp; He is much worse than his uncle.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Promising, I said, not performing.&nbsp; Whatever promise there 
may have been in Northmoor must have been nipped upon the top of a high 
stool, but if he has sense enough to put that boy into good hands he may 
come to something.&nbsp; I like him <!-- page 84--><a 
name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 84</span>enough myself to feel 
half inclined to do what I can towards licking him into shape, for the 
honour of the family!&nbsp; It is that girl Ida that riles me 
most.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Lady Adela, &lsquo;she behaved fairly well in 
company, but I saw her tittering and whispering with Emily Trotman in a 
tone that I thought very bad for Emily.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She&rsquo;s spoilt; her mother worships her,&rsquo; said 
Bertha.&nbsp; &lsquo;I had a pleasing confidence or two about how she is 
already admired, or, as Mrs. Morton calls it, how the gentlemen are after 
her; but now she shall not put up with anything but a <i>real</i> 
gentleman, and of course her uncle will do something handsome for 
her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Poor man!&nbsp; I wish him joy.&nbsp; Has he more 
belongings?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Providentially, no.&nbsp; We have the honour of standing nearest 
to him, and she seems to have none at all, unless they should be attracted 
by the scent.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That is not likely,&rsquo; said Lady Adela; &lsquo;she was a 
clergy orphan, and never heard of any relations.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then you really know no harm of them, in these four or five 
months?&rsquo; said Mrs. Bury.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No; except having these relations,&rsquo; said Adela.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Except being just sensible enough not to afford even the pleasure
of laughing at them,&rsquo; said Bertha.&nbsp; &lsquo;Nay, just worthy 
enough&rsquo;&mdash;she said it spitefully&mdash;&lsquo;not even to give 
the relief of a good grumble.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, I think you may be thankful!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Exactly what one doesn&rsquo;t want to be!&rsquo; said 
Bertha.&nbsp; &lsquo;I like sensations.&nbsp; Now Letitia is going <!-- 
page 85--><a name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 85</span>to come 
down with a prediction that they are to become the blessings of our lives, 
so I am off!&rsquo;</p>
<p>And as the door closed on her, Lady Adela sighed, and Mrs. Bury 
said&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Poor Birdie; is she always in that tone?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Lady Adela; &lsquo;there seems to be always a 
bitter spot in her heart.&nbsp; I am glad she should try to work it 
out.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I suppose living here with her father tended to brooding.&nbsp; 
Yet she has always done a good deal.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not up to her powers.&nbsp; Lord Northmoor never ceased to think 
her a mere girl, and obstructed her a good deal; besides, all his interest 
being in horses, she never could get rid of the subject, and wounds were 
continually coming back on us&mdash;on her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;On you as well, poor Addie.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He did not understand.&nbsp; Besides, to me these things were not
the raw scene they were to her.&nbsp; It has been a very sad time for 
her.&nbsp; You see, there is not much natural softness in her, and she was 
driven into roughness and impatience when he worried her over racing 
details and other things.&nbsp; And then she was hurt at his preferring to 
have me with him.&nbsp; It has been very good and generous in her not to 
have been jealous of me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I think she was glad he could find comfort in you.&nbsp; And you 
have never heard of Captain Alder?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Never!&nbsp; In justice, and for the sake of dear Arthur&rsquo;s 
wishes, I should be glad to explain; but I wonder whether, as she is now, 
it would be well that they should meet.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If it is so ordained, I suppose they will.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s 
that?&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 86--><a name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 86</span>It
was Lord and Lady Northmoor, formally announced, and as formally 
introduced, to Mrs. Bury.</p>
<p>They had come, the lady said, when they were seated, with a message from
&lsquo;Old Swan,&rsquo; to ask for a bit of my lady&rsquo;s plaster for his
back to ease his rheumatism at night.&nbsp; His daughter was only just come
in from work, so they had ventured to bring the message.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is any one coming for it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I said we would bring it back,&rsquo; replied Mary, &lsquo;if you
would kindly let us have it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, it is a mile out of your way!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is moonlight, and we do so enjoy a walk together,&rsquo; she 
answered.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, Adela,&rsquo; said Mrs. Bury, when they were gone with the 
roll of plaster, &lsquo;I agree that they might be worse&mdash;and by a 
great deal!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did he speak all the time?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, once.&nbsp; But there are worse faults than silence; and she
seems a bonny little woman.&nbsp; Honeymooning still&mdash;that moonlight 
walk too.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I can fancy that it is a treat to escape from Mrs. Morton.&nbsp; 
She is depths below them in refinement!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;On the whole, I think you may be thankful, Adela.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I hope I am.&nbsp; I believe you would soon be intimate with 
them; but then you always could get on with all sorts of people, and I have
a shrinking from getting under the surface&mdash;if I 
<i>could</i>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And indeed, further intercourse, though not without shocks and 
casualties, made Mary <!-- page 87--><a name="page87"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 87</span>Northmoor wish that Letitia Bury had been the 
permanent inhabitant; above all, when she undertook to come and give her 
counsel and support for that first tremendous undertaking&mdash;the 
dinner-party.&nbsp; Lady Kenton was equally helpful at their next; and Sir 
Edward gave much good advice to his lordship as to not letting himself be 
made the tool of the loud-voiced squire, who was anxious to be his guide, 
philosopher, and friend in county business&mdash;advice that made 
Frank&rsquo;s heart sink, for thus far he felt only capable of sitting 
still and listening.</p>

WESTHAVEN VERSIONS OF HONOURS</h2>
<p>&lsquo;Thank you, a bit of partridge, Mr. Rollstone, if you 
please.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Excuse me, Mrs. Grover.&nbsp; This is a grouse from Lord 
Northmoor&rsquo;s own moors, I presume,&rsquo; replied Mr. Rollstone, to 
the tune of a peal of laughter from Herbert and 
exclamation&mdash;&lsquo;Not know a grouse!&rsquo;&mdash;for which Ida 
frowned at him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, indeed,&rsquo; said his mother; &lsquo;we had so much game 
up at my brother&rsquo;s, Lord Northmoor&rsquo;s, that I shall quite miss 
it now I am come away.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Flimsy sort of grub!&rsquo; growled an old skipper.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;Only fit for this sort of a tea&mdash;not to make a real meal on, 
fit for &ldquo;a man&rdquo;!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The young folk laughed.&nbsp; Captain Purdy was only invited as a 
messmate of Mrs. Morton&rsquo;s father.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;ll excuse this being only a tea,&rsquo; went on Mrs. 
Morton.&nbsp; &lsquo;I hope to have a dinner in something more of style if 
ever I return here, but I could not attempt it with my present 
establishment after what we have got accustomed to.&nbsp; Why, <!-- page 
89--><a name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 89</span>we never sat 
down to dinner without two menservants!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Only two?&rsquo; said Mr. Rollstone.&nbsp; &lsquo;I have never 
been without three men under me; and I always had two to wait, even when 
the lady dined alone.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Grover, who had been impressed for a moment, took courage to 
say&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think so much of your grouse, Mrs. Morton.&nbsp; 
It&rsquo;s tasty and &rsquo;igh.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;High game goes with high families,&rsquo; wickedly murmured 
Herbert, causing much tittering at his corner of the table; and this grew 
almost convulsive, while another matron of the party observed&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mrs. Macdonald, Mr. Holt&rsquo;s sister in Scotland, once sent us
some, and really, Mrs. Morton, if you boil them down, they are almost as 
good as a pat-ridge!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, really now, Mrs. Holt!&nbsp; I hope you didn&rsquo;t tell 
Mrs. Macdonald so!&rsquo; said Mrs. Morton.&nbsp; &lsquo;It is a real 
valuable article, such as my brother, Lord Northmoor, would only send to 
us, and one or two old friends that he wishes to compliment at 
Hurminster.&nbsp; But one must be used to high society to know how such 
things should be relished!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Are Lord Northmoor&rsquo;s moors extensive?&rsquo; asked Mr. 
Rollstone.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There&rsquo;s about four or five miles of them,&rsquo; responded 
Herbert; &lsquo;and these grouse are awfully shy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, the Earl of Blackwing owns full twenty miles of 
heather,&rsquo; said the ex-butler.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Barren stuff!&rsquo; growled the skipper; &lsquo;breeding nothing
worth setting one&rsquo;s teeth into!&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 90--><a name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
90</span>&lsquo;There are seven farms besides,&rsquo; put in Mrs. 
Morton.&nbsp; &lsquo;My brother is going to have an audit-day next 
week.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You should have seen the Earl&rsquo;s audits,&rsquo; said Mr. 
Rollstone.&nbsp; &lsquo;Five-and-twenty substantial tenant-farmers, besides
artisans, and all the family plate on the sideboard!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, you should see the Northmoor plate!&rsquo; said Mrs. 
Morton.&nbsp; &lsquo;There are racing cups, four of them&mdash;not that any
one could drink out of them, for they are just centre-pieces for the 
table.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s a man in armour galloping off headlong with a 
girl behind him&mdash;&nbsp; Who did your uncle say it was, 
Conny?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The Templar and Rowena, mamma,&rsquo; said Constance.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, that was the best&mdash;all frosted.&nbsp; I liked that 
better than the one where the girl with no clothes to speak of was running 
like mad after a golden ball.&nbsp; They said that was an heirloom, worth 
five hundred&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Lord Burnside&rsquo;s yachting cups are valued at five 
thousand,&rsquo; said Mr. Rollstone.&nbsp; &lsquo;I should know, for I had 
the care of them, and it was a responsibility as weighed on my 
mind.&rsquo;</p>
<p>So whatever Mrs. Morton described as to the dignities and splendours of 
Northmoor, Mr. Rollstone continued to cap with more magnificent 
experiences, so that, though he never pretended to view himself in the 
light of a participator in the grandeur he described, he continued, quite 
unintentionally, so to depreciate the glories of Northmoor, that Mrs. 
Morton began to recollect how far above him her <!-- page 91--><a 
name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 91</span>sphere had become, and 
to decide against his future admission to her parties.</p>
<p>The young ladies, as soon as tea was over, retired into corners in 
pairs, having on their side much to communicate.&nbsp; Rose Rollstone was 
at home for a holiday, after having begun to work at an establishment for 
art and ecclesiastical needlework, and it was no small treat to her and 
Constance to meet and compare their new experiences.&nbsp; Rose, always 
well brought up by her father, was in a situation carefully trained by a 
lady head, and watched over by those who deepened and cultivated her 
religious feeling; and Constance had to tell of the new facilities of 
education offered to them.&nbsp; Ida was too delicate for school, their 
mother said, and was only to have music lessons at Brighton, or in London 
whenever the present house could be parted with; but Herbert had already 
begun to work with a tutor for the army, and Constance was to go to the 
High School at Colbeam and spend her Sundays at Northmoor, where a 
prettily-furnished room was set apart for her.&nbsp; She described it with 
so much zest that Rose was seized with a sort of alarm.&nbsp; &lsquo;You 
will live there like all the lords and ladies that papa talks of, and grow 
worldly and fashionable.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh no, no,&rsquo; cried Constance, and there was a girlish 
kissing match, but Rose seemed to think worldliness inevitable.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The Earl my papa lived with used to bet and gamble, and come home
dreadfully late at night, and so did my lady and her daughters, and their 
poor maid had to sit up for them till four o&rsquo;clock in the 
morning.&nbsp; Then their bills!&nbsp; They never told <!-- page 92--><a 
name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 92</span>his lordship, but they 
sold their diamonds and wore paste.&nbsp; His lordship did not know, but 
their maid did, and told papa.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Constance opened her eyes and declared that Uncle Frank and Aunt Mary 
never could do such things.&nbsp; Moreover, she averred that Lady Adela was
always going about among the cottages, and that Miss Morton had not a bit 
of pride, and was going to live in London to teach the dust-pickers and 
match-box makers.&nbsp; &lsquo;Indeed, I don&rsquo;t think they are half as
worldly in themselves,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;as Ida is growing with 
thinking about them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, don&rsquo;t you remember the sermon that said worldliness 
didn&rsquo;t depend on what one has, but what one is?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Talking of nothing better than sermons!&rsquo; said Herbert, 
coming on them.&nbsp; &lsquo;Have you caught it of the governor, Con?&nbsp;
I believe he thinks of nothing but sermons.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And Constance exclaimed, &lsquo;I am sure he doesn&rsquo;t 
preach!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh no, nothing comes out of his mouth that he can help; trust him
for that.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then how do you know?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;By the stodgy look of him.&nbsp; He would be the awfullest of 
prosers if he had the gift of the gab.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are an ungrateful boy,&rsquo; said Rose.&nbsp; &lsquo;I am 
sure he must be very kind to you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Can&rsquo;t help it,&rsquo; said Herbert.&nbsp; &lsquo;The old 
fellow would be well enough if he had any go in him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am sure he took you out hunting,&rsquo; exclaimed Constance 
indignantly, &lsquo;the day they took us to the meet.&nbsp; And he leapt 
all the ditches when you&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 93--><a name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 93</span>He
broke in, &lsquo;Well, what was I to do when I&rsquo;ve never had the 
chance to learn to sit a horse?&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll see next 
winter.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did you hurt yourself?&rsquo; asked Rose, rather 
mischievously.</p>
<p>To which Herbert turned a deaf ear and began to expatiate upon the game 
of Northmoor, till other sounds led him away to fall upon the other 
<i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i> between Ida and Sibyl Grover.&nbsp; 
In Ida&rsquo;s mind the honours of Northmoor were dearly purchased by the 
dulness and strictness of the life there.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My uncle was as cross as two sticks if ever Herbert or I were too
late for prayers, and he said it was nonsense of Herbert to say that 
kneeling at church spoilt his trousers&mdash;kneeling just like a school 
child!&nbsp; It made me so faint!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And it looks so!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I tried, because Lady Adela and Miss Bertha and all do,&rsquo; 
said Ida, &lsquo;and they looked at me!&nbsp; But it made me faint, as I 
knew it would,&rsquo; and she put her head on one side.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Poor dear!&nbsp; So they were so very religious!&nbsp; Did that 
spoil it all?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, we had pretty things off the Christmas-tree, and we lived 
quite as ladies, and drove out in the carriage.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No parties nor dances?&nbsp; Or were they too 
religious?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ma says it is their meanness; but my aunt, Lady Northmoor, did 
say perhaps it would be livelier another year, and then we should have had 
some dancing and deportment lessons.&nbsp; I up and told her I could dance 
fast enough now, but she said it <!-- page 94--><a name="page94"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 94</span>would not be becoming or right to Lady 
Adela&rsquo;s and Miss Morton&rsquo;s feelings.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do they live there?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not in the house.&nbsp; Lady Adela has a cottage of her own, and 
Miss Morton stops with her.&nbsp; Lady Adela is as high and standoffish as 
the monument,&rsquo; said Ida, pausing for a comparison.</p>
<p>&lsquo;High and haughty,&rsquo; said Sibyl, impressed.&nbsp; &lsquo;And 
the other lady?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, she is much more good-natured.&nbsp; We call her Bertha; at 
least, she told us that we might call her anything but that horrid Cousin 
Bertha, as she said.&nbsp; But she&rsquo;s old, thirty-six years old, and 
not a bit pretty, and she says such odd things, one doesn&rsquo;t know what
to do.&nbsp; She thought I made myself useful and could wash and 
iron,&rsquo; said Ida, as if this were the greatest possible insult, in 
which Sibyl acquiesced.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And she thought I should know the factory girls, just the 
hands,&rsquo; added Ida, greatly disgusted.&nbsp; &lsquo;As if I 
should!&nbsp; But ma says low tastes are in the family, for she is going to
live in London, and go and sit with the shop-girls in the evening.&nbsp; 
Still I like her better than Lady Adela, who keeps herself to 
herself.&nbsp; Mamma says it is pride and spite that her plain little 
sickly girl hasn&rsquo;t come to be my Lady.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What, doesn&rsquo;t she speak to them?&rsquo; said Sibyl, quite 
excited.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh yes, she calls, and shakes hands, and all that, but one never 
seems to get on with her.&nbsp; And Emily Trotman, she&rsquo;s the 
doctor&rsquo;s daughter, such a darling, told me <i>such</i> a 
history&mdash;so interesting!&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 95--><a name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
95</span>&lsquo;Tell me, Ida, there&rsquo;s a dear.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She says they were all frightfully dissipated&rsquo; (Ida said it
quite with a relish)&mdash;&lsquo;the old Lord and Mr. Morton, Lady 
Adela&rsquo;s husband, you know, and Miss Bertha&mdash;always racing and 
hunting and gambling and in debt.&nbsp; Then there came a Captain Alder, 
who was ever so much in love with Miss Bertha, but most awfully in debt to 
her brother, and very passionate besides.&nbsp; So he took him out in his 
dog-cart with a fiery horse that was sure to run away.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who did?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Captain Alder took Mr. Morton, though they begged and prayed him 
not, and the horse ran away and Mr. Morton was thrown out and 
killed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; with extreme zest.&nbsp; &lsquo;On purpose?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Miss Bertha was sure it was, so that she might have all the 
fortune, and so she told him, and flung the betrothal ring in his face, and
he went right off, and never has been heard of since.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, that <i>is</i> interesting.&nbsp; Do you think he shot 
himself?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, he was too mean.&nbsp; Most likely he married a hideous 
millionaire: but the Mortons were always dreadful, and did all sorts of 
wicked things.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I declare it&rsquo;s as good as any tale&mdash;like the sweet one
in the <i>Young Ladies&rsquo; Friend</i> now&mdash;&ldquo;The Pride of 
Pedro.&rdquo;&nbsp; Have you seen it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, indeed, uncle and aunt only have great old stupid 
books!&nbsp; They wanted me to read those horrid tiresome things of 
Scott&rsquo;s, and Dickens&rsquo;s too, who is as old as the hills!&nbsp; 
Why, they could not think of anything better to do on their wedding tour 
but to go to all the places in the Waverley novels.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 96--><a name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
96</span>&lsquo;Why, they are as bad as history!&nbsp; Jim brought one home
once, and pa wanted me to read it, but I could not get on with it&mdash;all
about a stupid king of France.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure if I married a lord 
I&rsquo;d make him do something nicer.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I mean ma to do something more jolly,&rsquo; said Ida, 
&lsquo;when we get more money, and I am come out.&nbsp; I mean to go to 
balls and tennis parties, and I shall be sure to marry a lord at some of 
them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And you will take me,&rsquo; cried Sibyl.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Only you must be very genteel,&rsquo; said Ida.&nbsp; &lsquo;Try 
to learn style, <i>do</i>, dear.&nbsp; It must be learnt young, you 
know!&nbsp; Why, there&rsquo;s Aunt Mary, when she has got ever so 
beautiful a satin dress on, she does not look half so stylish as Lady Adela
walking up the road in an old felt hat and a shepherd&rsquo;s-plaid 
waterproof!&nbsp; But they all do dress so as I should be ashamed.&nbsp; 
Only think what a scrape that got Herbert into.&nbsp; He was coming back 
one Saturday from his tutor&rsquo;s, and he saw walking up to the house an 
awfully seedy figure of fun, in an old old ulster, and such a hat as you 
never saw, with a knapsack on her back, and a portfolio under her 
arm.&nbsp; So of course he thought it was a tramp with something to sell, 
and he holloaed out, &ldquo;You&rsquo;d better come out of this!&nbsp; We 
want none of your sort.&rdquo;&nbsp; She just turned round and laughed, 
which put him in such a rage, that though she began to speak he 
didn&rsquo;t wait, but told her to have done with her sauce, or he would 
call the keepers.&nbsp; He thinks she said, &ldquo;You&rsquo;d 
better,&rdquo; and I believe he did move his stick a little.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ida, have done with that!&rsquo; cried Herbert&rsquo;s voice <!--
page 97--><a name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 97</span>close to 
her.&nbsp; &lsquo;Hold your tongue, or I&rsquo;ll&mdash;&rsquo; and his 
hand was near her hair.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t, don&rsquo;t, Herbert.&nbsp; Let me hear,&rsquo; 
cried Sibyl.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s the way girls go on,&rsquo; said Herbert fiercely, 
&lsquo;with their nonsense and stuff.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But who&mdash;?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If you go on, Ida&mdash;&rsquo; he was clutching her braid.</p>
<p>Sibyl sprang to the defence, and there was a general struggle and romp 
interspersed with screams, which was summarily stopped by Mr. Rollstone 
explaining severely, &lsquo;If you think that is the deportment of the 
aristocracy, Miss Ida, you are much mistaken.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Bother the aristocracy!&rsquo; broke out Herbert.</p>
<p>Calm was restored by a summons to a round game, but Sibyl&rsquo;s 
curiosity was of course insatiable, and as she sat next to Herbert, she 
employed various blandishments and sympathetic whispers, and after a great 
deal of fuss, and &lsquo;What will you give me if I tell?&rsquo; to extract
the end of the story, &lsquo;Did he call the keeper?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh yes, the old beast!&nbsp; His name&rsquo;s Best, but it ought 
to be Beast!&nbsp; He guffawed ever so much worse than she did!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, but who was it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>And after he had tried to make her guess, and teased his fill, he owned,
&lsquo;Mrs. Bury&mdash;a sort of cousin, staying with Lady Adela.&nbsp; She
isn&rsquo;t half a bad old party, but she makes a guy of herself, and goes 
about sketching and painting like a blessed old drawing-master.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 98--><a name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
98</span>&lsquo;A lady? and not a young lady.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not as old as&mdash;as Methuselah, or old Rolypoly there, but I 
believe she&rsquo;s a grandmother.&nbsp; If she&rsquo;d been a boy, we 
should have been cut out of it.&nbsp; Oh yes, she&rsquo;s a lady&mdash;a 
born Morton; and when it was over she was very jolly about it&mdash;no harm
done&mdash;bears no malice, only Ida makes such an absurd work about every 
little trifle.&rsquo;</p>

99</span>CHAPTER XV<br />
THE PIED ROOK</h2>
<p>Constance Morton was leaning on the rail that divided the gardens at 
Northmoor from the park, which was still rough and heathery.&nbsp; Of all 
the Morton family, perhaps she was the one who had the most profited by the
three years that had passed since her uncle&rsquo;s accession to the 
title.&nbsp; She had been at a good boarding-house, attending the High 
School in Colbeam, and spending Saturday and Sunday at Northmoor.&nbsp; It 
had been a happy life, she liked her studies, made friends with her 
companions, and enjoyed to the very utmost all that Northmoor gave her, in 
country beauty and liberty, in the kindness of her uncle and aunt, and in 
the religious training that they were able to give her, satisfying longings
of her soul, so that she loved them with all her heart, and felt Northmoor 
her true home.&nbsp; The holiday time at Westhaven was always a 
trial.&nbsp; Mrs. Morton had tried Brighton and London, but neither place 
agreed with Ida: and she found herself a much greater personage in her own 
world than elsewhere, and besides could not <!-- page 100--><a 
name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 100</span>always find tenants 
for her house.&nbsp; So there she lived at her ease, called by many of her 
neighbours the Honourable Mrs. Morton, and finding listeners to her 
alternate accounts of the grandeur of Northmoor, and murmurs at the 
meanness of its master in only allowing her &pound;300 a year, besides 
educating her children, and clothing two of them.</p>
<p>Ida considered herself to be quite sufficiently educated, and so she was
for the society in which she was, or thought herself, a star, chiefly 
consisting of the families of the shipowners, coalowners, and the 
like.&nbsp; She was pretty, with a hectic prettiness of bright eyes and 
cheeks, and had a following of the young men of the place; and though she 
always tried to enforce that to receive attentions from a smart young mate,
a clerk in an office, a doctor&rsquo;s assistant, or the like, was a great 
condescension on her part, she enjoyed them all the more.&nbsp; Learning 
new songs for their benefit, together with extensive novel reading, were 
her chief employments, and it was the greater pity because her health was 
not strong.&nbsp; She dreamt much in a languid way, and had imagination 
enough to work these tales into her visions of life.&nbsp; Her temper 
suffered, and Constance found the atmosphere less and less congenial as she
grew older and more accustomed to a different life.</p>
<p>She was a gentle, ladylike girl, with her brown hair still on her 
shoulders, as on that summer Saturday she stood looking along the path, but
with her ears listening for sounds from the house, and an anxious 
expression on her young face.&nbsp; Presently she started at the sound of a
gun, which <!-- page 101--><a name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
101</span>caused a mighty cawing among the rooks in the trees on the 
slopes, and a circling of the black creatures in the sky.&nbsp; A whistling
then was heard, and her brother Herbert came in sight in a few minutes 
more, a fine tall youth of sixteen, with quite the air and carriage of a 
gentleman.&nbsp; He had a gun on his shoulder, and carried by the claws the
body of a rook with white wings.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, Herbert,&rsquo; cried Constance in dismay, &lsquo;did you 
shoot that by mistake?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No; Stanhope would not believe there was such a crittur, and 
betted half a sov that it was a cram.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But how could you?&nbsp; Our uncle and aunt thought so much of 
that poor dear Whitewing, and Best was told to take care of it.&nbsp; They 
will be so vexed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nonsense!&nbsp; He&rsquo;ll come to more honour stuffed than ever
he would flying and howling up there.&nbsp; When I&rsquo;ve shown him to 
Stanhope, I shall make that old fellow at Colbeam come down handsomely for 
him.&nbsp; What a row those birds kick up!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll send my other 
barrel among them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh no, don&rsquo;t, Bertie.&nbsp; Uncle Frank has one of his 
dreadful headaches to-day.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Seems to me he is made of headaches.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, Aunt Mary is very anxious.&nbsp; Oh, I would have done 
anything that you had not vexed them now and killed this poor dear pretty 
thing!&rsquo; said Constance, stroking down the glossy feathers of the 
still warm victim, and laying them against her cheek, almost tearfully.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, you are not going to tell them.&nbsp; Perhaps <!-- page 
102--><a name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 102</span>they 
won&rsquo;t miss it.&nbsp; I would not have done it if Stanhope had not 
been such a beast,&rsquo; said Herbert.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I shall not tell them, of course,&rsquo; said Constance; 
&lsquo;but, if I were you, I should not be happy till they knew.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s only girl&rsquo;s way!&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t have 
the old Stick upset now, for I&rsquo;m in horrid want of tin.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, Bertie, was it true then?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What, you don&rsquo;t mean that they have heard?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That you were out at those Colbeam races!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;To be sure I was, with Stanhope and Hailes and a lot more.&nbsp; 
We all went except the little kids and Sisson, who is in regular training 
for as great a muff as the governor there.&nbsp; Who told him?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr. Hailes, who is very much concerned about his 
grandson.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Old sneak; I wonder how he ferreted it out.&nbsp; Is there no end
of a jaw coming, Con?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&nbsp; Uncle Frank seemed quite knocked down 
and wretched over it.&nbsp; He said something about feeling hopeless, and 
the old blood coming out to be your ruin.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of course it&rsquo;s the old blood!&nbsp; How did he miss it, and
turn into the intolerable old dry fogey that he is, without a notion of 
anything fit for a gentleman?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, Herbert&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh yes.&nbsp; You should just hear what the other fellows say 
about him.&nbsp; Their mothers and their sisters say there is not so stupid
a place in the county, he hasn&rsquo;t a word to say for himself, and they 
would just as soon go to Portland at once as to a party here.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 103--><a name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
103</span>&lsquo;Then it is a great shame!&nbsp; I am sure Aunt Mary works 
hard to make it pleasant for them!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh yes, good soul, she does, she can&rsquo;t help it; but when 
people have stuck in the mud all their lives, they can&rsquo;t know any 
better, and it is abominably hard on a fellow who does, to be under a man 
who has been an office cad all his life, and doesn&rsquo;t know what is 
expected of a gentleman!&nbsp; Screwing us all up like 
beggars&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Herbert, for shame! for shame!&nbsp; As if he was obliged to do 
anything at all for us!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, isn&rsquo;t he?&nbsp; A pretty row my mother would kick up 
about his ears if he did not, when I must come after him at this place, 
too!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I think you are very ungrateful,&rsquo; said Constance, with 
tears, &lsquo;when they are so good to us.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, they are as kind as they know how, but they don&rsquo;t 
know.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s the thing, or old Frank would be ashamed to give 
me such a dirty little allowance.&nbsp; He has only himself to thank if I 
have to come upon him for more.&nbsp; Found out about the Blackbird colt, 
has he?&nbsp; What a bore!&nbsp; And tin I must have out of him by hook or 
by crook if he cuts up ever so rough.&nbsp; I must send off this bird first
by the post to confute Stanhope and make him eat dirt, and then see 
what&rsquo;s to be done.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Indeed, Bertie, I don&rsquo;t think you will see him 
to-night.&nbsp; His head is dreadful, and Aunt Mary has sent for Mr. 
Trotman.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Whew!&nbsp; You have not got anything worth having, I suppose, 
Conny?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Only fifteen shillings.&nbsp; I meant it for&mdash;&nbsp; <!-- 
page 104--><a name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 104</span>But you
shall have it, dear Bertie, if it will only save worrying them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Fifteen bob!&nbsp; Fifteen farthings you might as well 
offer.&nbsp; No, no, you soft little monkey, I must see what is to be made 
of him or her ladyship, one or the other, to-day or to-morrow.&nbsp; If 
they know I have been at the place it is half the battle.&nbsp; Consequence
was!&nbsp; Provided they don&rsquo;t smell out this unlucky piebald!&nbsp; 
I wish Stanhope hadn&rsquo;t been such a beast!&rsquo;</p>
<p>At that moment, too late to avoid her, Lady Northmoor, pale and anxious,
came up the path and was upon them.&nbsp; &lsquo;Your uncle is 
asleep,&rsquo; she began, but then, starting, &lsquo;Oh, Conny.&nbsp; Poor 
Whitewing.&nbsp; Did you find him?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Constance hung her head and did not speak.&nbsp; Then her aunt saw how 
it was.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Herbert! you must have shot him by mistake; your uncle will be so
grieved.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Herbert was not base enough to let this pass.&nbsp; He muttered, 
&lsquo;A fellow would not take my word for it, so I had to show 
him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She looked at him very sadly.&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh, Herbert, I did not think 
you would have made that a reason for vexing your uncle!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The boy was more than half sorry under those gentle eyes.&nbsp; He 
muttered something about &lsquo;didn&rsquo;t think he would 
care.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She shook her head, instead of saying that she knew this was not the 
truth; and unable to bear the sting, he flung away from her, carrying the 
rook with him, and kicking the pebbles, trying to be angry instead of 
sorry.&nbsp; And just then came a summons to Lady Northmoor to see the 
doctor.</p>
<p><!-- page 105--><a name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
105</span>Yet Herbert Morton was a better boy than he seemed at that 
moment; his errors were chiefly caused by understanding <i>noblesse 
oblige</i> in a different way from his uncle.&nbsp; Moreover, it would have
been better for him if his tutor had lived beyond the neighbourhood of 
Northmoor, where he heard, losing nothing in the telling, the remarks of 
the other pupils&rsquo; mothers upon his uncle and aunt; more especially as
it was not generally the highest order of boy that was to be found 
there.&nbsp; If he had heard what the fathers said, he would have learnt 
that, though shy and devoid of small talk, and of the art of putting guests
together, Lord Northmoor was trusted and esteemed.&nbsp; He might perhaps 
be too easily talked down; he could not argue, and often gave way to the 
noisy Squire; but he was certain in due time to see the rights of a 
question, and he attended thoroughly to the numerous tasks of an active and
useful county man, taking all the drudgery that others shirked.&nbsp; 
While, if by severe stress he were driven to public speaking, he could 
acquit himself far better than any one had expected.&nbsp; The Bishop and 
the Chairman of the Quarter Sessions alike set him down on their 
committees, not only for his rank, but for his industry and steadiness of 
work.&nbsp; Nor had any one breathed any imputation upon the possession of 
what used to be known as gentility, before that good word was degraded, to 
mean something more like what Mrs. Morton aspired to.&nbsp; Lord and Lady 
Northmoor might not be lively, nor a great accession to society, but the 
anticipations of either amusement or annoyance from vulgarity or arrogance 
were entirely <!-- page 106--><a name="page106"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 106</span>disappointed.&nbsp; No one could call them 
underbred, or anything but an ingrain gentleman and lady, while there were 
a few who could uphold Lady Northmoor as thoroughly kind, sweet, sensible, 
and helpful to her utmost in all that was good.</p>
<p>All this, however, was achieved not only unconsciously but with severe 
labour by a man whose powers could only act slowly, and who was not to the 
manner born.&nbsp; Conscientiousness is a costly thing, and 
Strafford&rsquo;s watchword is not to be adopted for nothing.&nbsp; The 
balance of duties, the perplexities of managing an impoverished and 
involved estate, the disappointment of being unable to carry out the 
responsibilities of a landlord towards neglected cottagers, the incapacity 
of doing what would have been desirable for the Church, and the worry and 
harass that his sister-in-law did not spare, all told as his office work 
had never done, and in spite of quiet, happy hours with his Mary, and her 
devoted and efficient aid whenever it was possible, a course of disabling 
neuralgic headaches had set in, and a general derangement of health, which 
had become alarming, and called for immediate remedy.</p>
<h2><!-- page 107--><a name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
107</span>CHAPTER XVI<br />
WHAT IS REST?</h2>
<p>&lsquo;Rest, there is nothing for it but immediate rest and warm 
baths,&rsquo; said Lady Northmoor to Constance, who was waiting anxiously 
for the doctor&rsquo;s verdict some hours later.&nbsp; &lsquo;It is only 
being overdone&mdash;no, my dear, there is nothing really to fear, if we 
can only keep business and letters out of his way for a few weeks, my dear 
child.&rsquo;</p>
<p>For Constance, who had been dreadfully frightened by the sight of the 
physician&rsquo;s carriage, which seemed to her inexperienced eyes the omen
of something terrible, fairly burst into tears of relief.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, I am so glad!&rsquo; she said, as caresses passed&mdash;which
might have been those of mother and daughter for heartfelt sympathy and 
affection.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You will miss your Saturdays and Sundays, my dear,&rsquo; 
continued the aunt, &lsquo;for we shall have to go abroad, so as to be 
quite out of the way of everything.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Never mind that, dear aunt, if only Uncle Frank is better.&nbsp; 
Will it be long?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I cannot tell.&nbsp; He says six weeks, Dr. Smith <!-- page 
108--><a name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 108</span>says three 
months.&nbsp; It is to be bracing air&mdash;Switzerland, most 
likely.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, how delightful!&nbsp; How you will enjoy it!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It has always been a dream, and it is strange now to feel so 
downhearted about it,&rsquo; said her aunt, smiling.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Uncle Frank is sure to be better there,&rsquo; said 
Constance.&nbsp; &lsquo;Only think of the snowy mountains&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mont Blanc is the monarch of mountains;<br />
&nbsp;  They crown&rsquo;d him long ago<br />
On a throne of rocks, in a robe of clouds,<br />
&nbsp;  With a diadem of snow.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And the girl&rsquo;s eyes brightened with an enthusiasm that the elder 
woman felt for a moment, nor did either of them feel the verse 
hackneyed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, I wish we could take you, my dear,&rsquo; said Lady 
Northmoor; then, &lsquo;Do you know where Herbert is?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Constance.&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh, aunt, I am so 
sorry!&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t think he would have done it if the other boys 
had not teased him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Perhaps not; but, indeed, I am grieved, not only on the poor 
rook&rsquo;s account, but that he should have the heart to vex your uncle 
just now.&nbsp; However, perhaps he did not understand how ill he has been 
all this week.&nbsp; And I am afraid that young Stanhope is not a good 
companion for him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I do not think he is,&rsquo; said Constance; &lsquo;it seems to 
me that Stanhope leads him into that betting, and makes him think it does 
not signify whether he passes or not, and so he does not take 
pains.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Herbert was not to be found either then or at <!-- page 109--><a 
name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 109</span>dinner-time.&nbsp; It
turned out that he had taken from the stables the horse he was allowed to 
ride, and had gone over to display his victim to Stanhope, and then on to 
the bird-stuffer; had got a meal, no one wished to know how, only returning
in time to stump upstairs to bed.</p>
<p>He thus avoided an interview with his uncle over the rook, unaware that 
his aunt had left him the grace of confession, being in hopes that, unless 
he did speak of his own accord, the vexatious knowledge might be spared to 
one who did not need an additional annoyance just then.</p>
<p>Lord Northmoor was not, however, to be spared.&nbsp; He was much better 
the next day, Sunday, a good deal exhilarated by the doctor&rsquo;s 
opinion; and, though concerned at having to break off his work, ready to 
enjoy what he was told was absolutely essential.</p>
<p>The head-keeper had no notion of sparing him.&nbsp; Mr. Best regarded 
him with a kind of patronising toleration as an unfortunate gentleman who 
had the ill-hap never to have acquired a taste for sport, and was unable to
do justice to his preserves; but towards &lsquo;Mr. Morton&rsquo; there was
a very active dislike.&nbsp; The awkward introduction might have rankled 
even had Herbert been wise enough to follow Miss Morton&rsquo;s advice; but
his nature was overbearing, and his self-opinion was fostered by his mother
and Ida, while he was edged on by his fellow-pupils to consider Best a mere
old woman, who could only be tolerated by the ignorance of &lsquo;a regular
Stick.&rsquo;</p>
<p>With the under-keeper Herbert fraternised enough to make him 
insubordinate; and the days when Lord Northmoor gave permission for 
shooting <!-- page 110--><a name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
110</span>or for inviting his companions for a share in the sport, were 
days of mutual offence, when the balance of provoking sneer and angry 
insult would be difficult to cast, though the keeper was the most 
forbearing, since he never complained of personal ill-behaviour to himself,
whereas Herbert&rsquo;s demonstrations to his uncle of &lsquo;that old 
fool&rsquo; were the louder and more numerous because they never produced 
the slightest effect.</p>
<p>However, Best felt aggrieved in the matter of the rook, which had been 
put under his special protection, and being, moreover, something of a 
naturalist, he had cherished the hope of a special Northmoor breed of pied 
rooks.</p>
<p>So while, on the way from church, Lady Adela was detaining Lady 
Northmoor with inquiries as to Dr. Smith, Best waylaid his master with, 
&lsquo;Your lordship gave me orders about that there rook with white wings,
as was not to be mislested.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Has anything happened to it?&rsquo; said Frank wearily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, my lord, I sees Mr. Morton going up to the rookery with his
gun, and I says to him that it weren&rsquo;t time for shooting of the 
branchers, and the white rook weren&rsquo;t to be touched by nobody, and he
swears at me for a meddling old leggings, and uses other language as 
I&rsquo;ll not repeat to your lordship, and by and by I hears his gun, and 
I sees him a-picking up of the rook that her ladyship set such store by, so
it is due to myself, my lord, to let you know as I were not to 
blame.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Certainly not, Best,&rsquo; was the reply.&nbsp; &lsquo;I am 
exceedingly displeased that my nephew has behaved so ill to you, and I 
shall let him know it.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 111--><a name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
111</span>&lsquo;His lordship will give it to him hot and strong, the young
upstart,&rsquo; muttered Best to himself with great satisfaction, as he 
watched the languid pace quicken to overtake the boy, who had gone on with 
his sister.</p>
<p>Perhaps the irritability of illness had some effect upon the ordinary 
gentleness of Lord Northmoor&rsquo;s temper, and besides, he was 
exceedingly annoyed at such ungrateful slaughter of what was known to be a 
favourite of his wife; so when he came upon Herbert, sauntering down to the
stables, he accosted him sharply with, &lsquo;What is this I hear, 
Herbert?&nbsp; I could not have believed that you would have deliberately 
killed the creature that you knew to be a special delight to your 
aunt.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Herbert had reached the state of mind when a third, if not a fourth, 
reproach on the same subject on which his conscience was already uneasy, 
was simply exasperating, and without the poor excuse he had offered his 
aunt and sister, he burst out that it was very hard that such a beastly row
should be made about a fellow knocking down mere trumpery vermin.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Speak properly, Herbert, or hold your tongue,&rsquo; said his 
uncle.&nbsp; &lsquo;I am extremely displeased at finding that you do not 
know how to conduct yourself to my servants, and have presumed to act in 
this lawless, heartless manner, in defiance of what you knew to be your 
aunt&rsquo;s wishes and my orders, and that you replied to Best&rsquo;s 
remonstrance with insolence.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s a good one!&nbsp; Insolent to an old fool of a 
keeper,&rsquo; muttered Herbert sullenly.</p>
<p><!-- page 112--><a name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
112</span>&lsquo;Insolence is shameful towards any man,&rsquo; returned his
uncle.&nbsp; &lsquo;And from a foolish headstrong boy to a faithful old 
servant it is particularly unbecoming.&nbsp; However, bad as this is, it is
not all that I have to speak of.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Then Herbert recollected with dismay how much his misdemeanour would 
tell against his pardon for the more important act of disobedience, and he 
took refuge in a sullen endeavour at indifference, while his uncle, 
thoroughly roused, spoke of the sins of disobedience and the dangers of 
betting.&nbsp; Perhaps the only part of the lecture that he really heard 
was, &lsquo;Remember, it was these habits in those who came before us that 
have been so great a hindrance in life to both you and me, and made you, my
poor boy, so utterly mistaken as to what becomes your position.&nbsp; How 
much have you thrown away?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Herbert looked up and muttered the amount&mdash;twelve pounds and some 
shillings.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very well, I will not have it owed.&nbsp; I shall pay it, 
deducting two pounds from your allowance each term till it is made 
up.&nbsp; Give me the address or addresses.&rsquo;</p>
<p>At this Herbert writhed and remonstrated, but his uncle was 
inexorable.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The fellows will be at me,&rsquo; he said, as he gave 
Stanhope&rsquo;s name.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You will see no more of Stanhope after this week.&nbsp; I have 
arranged to send you to a tutor in Hertfordshire, who I hope will make you 
work, and where, I trust, you will find companions who will give you a 
better idea of what becomes a gentleman.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In point of fact, this had been arranged for <!-- page 113--><a 
name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 113</span>some time past, 
though by the desire of Herbert&rsquo;s present tutor it had not been made 
known to the young people, so that, coming thus, there was a sound of 
punishment in it to Herbert.</p>
<p>The interview ended there.&nbsp; The annoyance, enhanced in his mind by 
having come on a Sunday, brought on another attack of headache; but late in
the evening he sent for Herbert, who always had to go very early on the 
Monday.&nbsp; It was to ask him whether he would not prefer the payment 
being made to Stanhope and the other pupil after he had left them.&nbsp; 
Herbert&rsquo;s scowl passed off.&nbsp; It was a great relief.&nbsp; He 
said they were prepared to wait till he had his allowance, and the act of 
consideration softened him, as did also the manifest look of suffering and 
illness, as his uncle lay on the couch, hardly able to speak, and yet 
exerting himself thus to spare the lad.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank you, sir,&rsquo; actually Herbert said, and then, with a 
gulp, &lsquo;I am sorry about that bird&mdash;I wish I&rsquo;d never told 
them, but it was Stanhope who drove me to it, not believing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I thought it was not your better mind,&rsquo; said his uncle, 
holding out his hand.&nbsp; &lsquo;I should like you to make me a promise, 
Herbert, not to make a bet while I am away.&nbsp; I should go with an 
easier mind.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will, uncle,&rsquo; said Herbert, heartily reflecting, perhaps,
it must be owned, on the fewer opportunities in that line at Westhaven, 
except at the regatta, but really resolving, as the only salve to his 
conscience.&nbsp; And there was that in his face and the clasp of his hand 
that gave his uncle a sense of comfort and hope.</p>

ON THE SURFACE</h2>
<p>Lady Adela, though small and pale, was one of the healthy women who seem
unable to believe in any ailments short of a raging fever; and when she 
heard of neuralgia, decided that it was all a matter of imagination, and a 
sort of excuse for breaking off the numerous occupations in which she felt 
his value, but only as she would have acknowledged that of a good 
schoolmaster.&nbsp; Their friendly intercourse had never ripened into 
intimacy, and was still punctiliously courteous; each tacitly dreaded the 
influence of the other on the Vicar-in-Church matters, and every visit of 
the Westhaven family confirmed Lady Adela&rsquo;s belief that it was 
undesirable to go below the surface.</p>
<p>Bertha, who came down for a day or two to assist at the breaking-up 
demonstration of the High School at Colbeam, was as ever much more 
cordial.&nbsp; The chief drawbacks with her were that cynical tone, which 
made it always doubtful whether she were making game of her hearers, and 
the philanthropy, not greatly tinged with religion, so as to <!-- page 
115--><a name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 115</span>confuse 
old-fashioned minds.&nbsp; She used to bring down strange accounts of her 
startling adventures in the slums, and relate them in a rattling style, 
interluded with slang, being evidently delighted to shock and puzzle her 
hearers; but still she was always good-natured in deed if not in word, and 
Lord Northmoor was very grateful for her offer of hospitality to Herbert, 
who was coming to London for his preliminary examination.</p>
<p>She had come up to call, determined to be of use to them, and she had 
experience enough of travelling to be very helpful.&nbsp; Finding that they
shuddered at the notion of fashionable German &lsquo;<i>baden</i>,&rsquo; 
she exclaimed&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll hit you off!&nbsp; There&rsquo;s that place in the 
Austrian Tyrol that Lettice Bury frequents&mdash;a regular primitive place 
with a name&mdash;Oh, what is it, Addie, like rats and mice?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ratzes,&rsquo; said Adela.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes.&nbsp; The tourists have not molested it yet, and only 
natives bathe there, so she goes every year to renovate herself and sketch,
and comes back furbished up like an old snake, with lots of drawings of 
impossible peaks, like Titian&rsquo;s backgrounds.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll write 
and tell her to make ready for the head of her house!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, but&mdash;&rsquo; began Frank, looking to his wife.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Would it not be intruding?&rsquo; said Mary.</p>
<p>&lsquo;She will be enchanted!&nbsp; She always likes to have anything to
do for anybody, and she says the scenery is just a marvel.&nbsp; You care 
for that!&nbsp; You are so deliciously fresh, beauties aren&rsquo;t a bore 
to you.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 116--><a name="page116"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
116</span>&lsquo;We are glad of the excuse,&rsquo; said Frank gravely.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You look ill enough to be an excuse for anything, and Mary 
too!&nbsp; How about a maid?&nbsp; Is Harte going?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Mary; &lsquo;she says that foreign food made her 
so ill once before that she cannot attempt going again.&nbsp; I meant to do
without.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That would never do!&rsquo; cried Bertha.&nbsp; &lsquo;You have 
quite enough on your hands with Northmoor, and the luggage and the 
languages.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is not an English maid apt to be another trouble?&rsquo; said 
Mary.&nbsp; &lsquo;I do not suppose my French is good, but I have had to 
talk it constantly; and I know some German, if that will serve in the 
Tyrol.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll reconcile it to your consciences,&rsquo; said Bertha 
triumphantly.&nbsp; &lsquo;It will be a real charity.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s a
bonny little Swiss girl whom some reckless people brought home and then 
turned adrift.&nbsp; It will be a real kindness to help her home, and you 
shall pick her up when you come up to me on your way, and see my 
child!&nbsp; Oh, didn&rsquo;t I tell you?&nbsp; We had a housemaid once who
was demented enough to marry a scamp of a stoker on one of the Thames 
steamers.&nbsp; He deserted her, and I found her living, or rather dying, 
in an awful place at Rotherhithe, surrounded by tipsy women, raging in 
opposite corners.&nbsp; I got her into a decent room, but too late to save 
her life&mdash;and a good thing too; so I solaced her last moments with a 
promise to look after her child, such a jolly little mortal, in spite of 
her name&mdash;Boadicea Ethelind Davidina Jones.&nbsp; She is two years 
old, and quite delicious&mdash;the darling of all the house!&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 117--><a name="page117"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
117</span>&lsquo;I hope you will have no trouble with the father,&rsquo; 
said Frank.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I trust he has gone to his own locker, or, if not, he is only too
glad to be rid of her.&nbsp; I can tackle him,&rsquo; said Bertha 
confidently.&nbsp; &lsquo;The child is really a little duck!&rsquo;</p>
<p>She spoke as if the little one filled an empty space in her heart; and, 
even though there might be trouble in store, it was impossible not to be 
glad of her present gladness, and her invitation was willingly 
accepted.&nbsp; Moreover, her recommendations were generally trustworthy, 
and Mary only hesitated because, she said&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I thought, if I could do without a maid, we might take 
Constance.&nbsp; She is doing so very well, and likely to pass so well in 
her examinations, that it would be very nice to give her this 
pleasure.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Good little girl!&nbsp; So it would.&nbsp; I should like nothing 
better; but I am afraid that if you took her without a maid, Emma would 
misunderstand it, and say you wanted to save the expense.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Would it make much difference?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not more than we could bear now that we are in for it, but I fear
it would excite jealousies.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is that worse than leaving the poor child to Westhaven society 
all the holidays?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Perhaps not; and Conny is old enough now to be more injured by it
than when she was younger.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You know I have always hoped to make her like a child of our own 
when her school education is finished.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Frank smiled, for he was likewise very fond of little Constance.</p>
<p><!-- page 118--><a name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
118</span>There was a public distribution of prizes, at which all the 
grandees of the neighbourhood were expected to assist, and it was some 
consolation to the Northmoors, for the dowager duchess being absent, that 
the pleasure of taking the prize from her uncle would be all the 
greater&mdash;if&mdash;</p>
<p>The whole party went&mdash;Lady Adela, Miss Morton, and all&mdash;and 
were installed in chairs of state on the platform, with the bright array of
books before them&mdash;the head-mistress telling Lady Northmoor beforehand
that her niece would have her full share of honours.&nbsp; No one could be 
a better or more diligent girl.</p>
<p>It quite nerved Lord Northmoor when he looked forth upon the sea of 
waving tresses of all shades of brown, while his wife watched in 
nervousness, both as to how he would acquit himself and how the exertion 
would affect him; and Bertha, as usual, was anxious for the credit of the 
name.</p>
<p>He did what was needed.&nbsp; Nobody wanted anything but the sensible 
commonplace, kindly spoken, about the advantages of good opportunities, the
conscientiousness of doing one&rsquo;s best.&nbsp; And after all, the 
inferiority of mere attainments in themselves to the discipline and 
dutifulness of responding to training,&mdash;it was slowly but not 
stammeringly spoken, and Bertha did not feel critical or ashamed, but 
squeezed Mary&rsquo;s hand, and said, &lsquo;Just the right 
thing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>One by one the girls were summoned for their prizes, the little ones 
first.&nbsp; Lord Northmoor had not the gift of inventing a pretty speech 
for each, he could do no more than smile as he presented the <!-- page 
119--><a name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 119</span>book, and 
read its name; but the smile was a very decided one when, in the class next
to the highest, three out of the seven prizes were awarded to Constance 
Elizabeth Morton, and it might be a question which had the redder cheeks, 
the uncle or the niece, as he handed them to her.&nbsp; It was one of the 
few happinesses that he had derived from his brother&rsquo;s family!</p>
<p>After such achievements on Constance&rsquo;s part, it was impossible to 
withhold&mdash;as they drove back to Northmoor&mdash;the proposal to take 
her with them, and the effect was magical.&nbsp; Constance opened her eyes,
bounded up, as if she were going to fly out of the carriage, and then 
launched herself, first on her uncle, then on her aunt, for an ecstatic 
kiss.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Take care, take care, we shall have the servants thinking you a 
little lunatic!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am almost!&nbsp; Oh, I am so glad!&nbsp; To be with you and 
Aunt Mary all the holidays!&nbsp; That would be enough!&nbsp; But to go and
see all the places,&rsquo; she added, somehow perceiving that the desire to
escape from home was, at least ought not to be approved of, and yet there 
was some exultation, when she hazarded a supposition that there was no time
to go home.</p>
<h2><!-- page 120--><a name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
120</span>CHAPTER XVIII<br />
DESDICHADO</h2>
<p>Home&mdash;that is to say, Westhaven&mdash;was in some commotion when 
Herbert came back and grimly growled out his intelligence as to his own 
personal affairs.&nbsp; Mrs. Morton had been already apprized, in one of 
Lord Northmoor&rsquo;s well-considered letters, of his intentions of 
removing his nephew to a tutor more calculated to prepare for the army, and
she had accepted this as promotion such as was his due.&nbsp; However, when
the pride of her heart, the tall gentlemanly son, made his appearance in a 
savage mood, her feelings were all on the other side, and those of Ida 
exaggerated hers.</p>
<p>&lsquo;So I&rsquo;m to go to some disgusting hole where they grind the 
fellows no end,&rsquo; was Herbert&rsquo;s account of the matter.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But surely with your connection there&rsquo;s no need for 
grinding?&rsquo; said his mother.</p>
<p>Herbert laughed, &lsquo;Much you know about it!&nbsp; Nobody cares a rap
for connections nowadays, even if old Frank were a connection to do a man 
any good.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But you&rsquo;ll not go and study hard and hurt <!-- page 
121--><a name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 121</span>yourself, my
dear,&rsquo; said his mother, though Herbert&rsquo;s looks by no means 
suggested any such danger, while Ida added, &lsquo;It is not as if he had 
nothing else to look to, you know.&nbsp; He can&rsquo;t keep you out of the
peerage.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Can&rsquo;t he then?&nbsp; Why, he can and will too, for thirty 
or forty years more at least.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I thought his health was failing,&rsquo; said Ida, putting into 
words a hope her mother had a little too much sense of propriety to 
utter.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Bosh, it&rsquo;s only neuralgia, just because he is such a stick 
he can&rsquo;t take things easy, and lark about and do every one&rsquo;s 
work&mdash;he hasn&rsquo;t the least notion what a gentleman ought to 
do.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is bred in the bone,&rsquo; said his mother; &lsquo;he always 
was a shabby poor creature!&nbsp; I always said he would not know how to 
spend his money.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He is a regular screw!&rsquo; responded Herbert.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;What do you think now!&nbsp; He was in no end of a rage with me just
because I went with some of the other fellows to the Colbeam races; and one
can&rsquo;t help a bet or two, you know.&nbsp; So I lost twelve pound or 
so, and what must he do but stop it out of my allowance two pound at a 
time!&rsquo;</p>
<p>There was a regular outcry at this, and Mrs. Morton declared her poor 
dear boy should not suffer, but she would make it up to him, and Herbert 
added that &lsquo;it had been unlucky, half of it was that they were riled 
with him, first because he had shot a ridiculous rook with white wings that
my lady made no end of a fuss about.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, then it is her spite,&rsquo; said Ida.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;She&rsquo;s a sly cat, with all her meek ways.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 122--><a name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
122</span>Herbert was not displeased with this evening&rsquo;s sympathy, as
he lay outspread on the sofa, with the admiring and pitying eyes of his 
mother and sister upon him; but he soon began to feel&mdash;when he had had
his grumble out, and could take his swing at home&mdash;that there could be
too much of it.</p>
<p>It was all very well to ease his own mind by complaining, but when he 
heard of Ida announcing that he had been shamefully treated, all out of 
spite for killing a white rook, his sense of justice made him declare that 
the notion was nothing but girl&rsquo;s folly, such as no person with a 
grain of sense could believe.</p>
<p>The more his mother and her friends persisted in treating him as an 
ill-used individual, the victim of his uncle&rsquo;s avarice and his 
aunt&rsquo;s spite, the more his better nature revolted and acknowledged 
inwardly and sometimes outwardly the kindness and justice he had met 
with.&nbsp; It was really provoking that any attempt to defend them, or 
explain the facts, were only treated as proofs of his own generous 
feeling.&nbsp; Ida&rsquo;s partisanship really did him more good than half 
a dozen lectures would have done, and he steadily adhered to his promise 
not to bet, though on the regatta day Ida and her friend Sibyl derided him 
for not choosing to risk even a pair of gloves; and while one pitied him, 
the other declared that he was growing a skinflint like his uncle.</p>
<p>He talked and laughed noisily enough to Ida&rsquo;s friends, but he had 
seen enough at Northmoor to feel the difference, and he told his sister 
that there was not a lady amongst the whole kit of them, except Rose 
Rollstone, who was coming down for her holiday.</p>
<p><!-- page 123--><a name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
123</span>&lsquo;Rose!&rsquo; cried Ida, tossing her head.&nbsp; &lsquo;A 
servant&rsquo;s daughter and a hand at a shop!&nbsp; What will you say 
next, I wonder?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Lady is as lady acts,&rsquo; said Herbert, making a new proverb, 
whereat his mother and sister in chorus rebuked him, and demanded to know 
whether Ida were not a perfect lady.</p>
<p>At which he laughed with a sound of scoffing, and being tired of the 
discussion sauntered out of the house to that inexhaustible occupation of 
watching the boats come in, and smoking with old acquaintances, who were 
still congenial to him, and declared that he had not become stuck-up, 
though he was turned into an awful swell!&nbsp; Perhaps they were less bad 
for him than Stanhope, for they inspired no spirit of imitation.</p>
<p>When he came back a later post had arrived, bringing the news of 
Constance&rsquo;s successes and of the invitation to her to share the 
expedition of her uncle and aunt.&nbsp; There was no question about letting
her go, but the feeling was scarcely of congratulation.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, little Conny knows how to play her cards!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Stuff&mdash;child wouldn&rsquo;t know what it meant,&rsquo; said 
Herbert glumly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said his sister, &lsquo;she always was the 
favourite, and I call it a shame.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What, because you&rsquo;ve been such a good girl, and got such 
honours and prizes?&rsquo; demanded Herbert.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nonsense, Herbert,&rsquo; said his mother.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;Ida&rsquo;s education was finished, you know.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, she wasn&rsquo;t a bit older than Conny is now.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 124--><a name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
124</span>&lsquo;And I don&rsquo;t hold with all that study, science and 
logic, and what d&rsquo;ye call it; that&rsquo;s no use to any one,&rsquo; 
continued his mother.&nbsp; &lsquo;It&rsquo;s not as if your sisters had to
be governesses.&nbsp; Give me a girl who can play a tune on the piano and 
make herself agreeable.&nbsp; Your uncle may do as he pleases, but 
he&rsquo;ll have Constance on his hands.&nbsp; The men don&rsquo;t fancy a 
girl that is always after books and lectures.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not of your sort, perhaps,&rsquo; said Herbert, &lsquo;but I 
don&rsquo;t care what I bet that Conny gets a better husband than 
Ida.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It stands to reason,&rsquo; Ida said, almost crying, &lsquo;when 
uncle takes her about to all these fine places and sets her up to be the 
favourite&mdash;just the youngest.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s not fair.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;As if she wasn&rsquo;t by a long chalk the better of the 
two,&rsquo; said Herbert.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, Bertie,&rsquo; interposed his mother, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll not 
have you teasing and running down your sister, though I do say it is a 
shame and a slight to pick out the youngest, when poor Ida is so delicate, 
and both of you two have ever so much better a right to favours.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s a good one!&rsquo; muttered Herbert, while Ida 
exclaimed&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of course, you know, aunt has always been nasty to me, ever since
I said ma said I was not strong enough to be bothered with that horrid 
school; and as to poor Herbert, they have spited him because he shot 
that&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Shut up, Ida,&rsquo; shouted Herbert.&nbsp; &lsquo;I 
wouldn&rsquo;t go with them if they went down on their knees to me!&nbsp; 
What should I do, loafing about among a <!-- page 125--><a 
name="page125"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 125</span>lot of disputing 
frog-eaters, without a word of a Christian language, and old Frank with his
nose in a guide-book wanting me to look at beastly pictures and rum old 
cathedrals.&nbsp; You would be a fish out of water, too, Ida.&nbsp; Now 
Conny will take to it like a house afire, and what&rsquo;s more, she 
deserves it!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, ma,&rsquo; put in the provoked Ida, &lsquo;I wonder you let
Conny go, when it would do me so much good, and it is so unfair.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My dear, you don&rsquo;t understand a mother&rsquo;s 
feelings.&nbsp; I feel the slight for you, but your uncle must be allowed 
to have his way.&nbsp; He is at all the expense, and to refuse for Conny 
would do you no good.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Except that she will be more set up than ever,&rsquo; murmured 
Ida.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, come now!&nbsp; I wonder which looks more like the set-up 
one,&rsquo; said Herbert, whose wider range had resulted in making him much
alive to Ida&rsquo;s shortcomings, and who looked on at her noisy style of 
flirtation with the eye of a grave censor.&nbsp; Whatever he might be 
himself, he knew what a young lady ought to be.</p>
<p>He triumphed a little when, during the few days spent in London, 
Constance wrote of a delightful evening when, while her uncle and aunt and 
Miss Morton had gone to an entertainment for Bertha&rsquo;s match-box 
makers, she had been permitted to have Rose Rollstone to spend the time 
with her, the carriage, by their kind contrivance, fetching the girl both 
in going and coming.</p>
<p>The two young things had been thoroughly happy together.&nbsp; Rose had 
gone on improving <!-- page 126--><a name="page126"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 126</span>herself; her companions in the art embroidery 
line were girls of a good class, with a few ladies among them, and their 
tone was good and refined.&nbsp; It was the fashion among them to attend 
the classes, Bible and secular, put in their way, and their employers 
conscientiously attended to their welfare, so that Rose was by no means an 
unfitting companion for the High School maiden, and they most happily 
compared notes over their very different lives, when they were not engaged 
in playing with little Cea, as the unwieldy name of Miss Morton&rsquo;s 
<i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;e</i> had been softened.&nbsp; She was a very 
pretty little creature, with big blue eyes and hair that could be called 
golden, and very full of life and drollery, so that she was a treat to 
both; and when the housemaid, whose charge she was, insisted on her coming 
to bed, they begged to superintend her evening toilet, and would have 
played antics with her in her crib half the night if they had not been 
inexorably chased away.</p>
<p>Then they sat down on low stools in the balcony, among the flowers, in 
convenient proximity for the caresses they had not yet outgrown, and had 
what they called &lsquo;a sweet talk.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Constance had been much impressed with the beauty of the embroidery, and
thought it must be delightful to do such things.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, for the forewoman,&rsquo; said Rose, &lsquo;but 
there&rsquo;s plenty of dull work; the same over and over again, and one 
little stitch ever so small gone amiss throws all wrong.&nbsp; Miss Grey 
told us to recollect it was just like our lives!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s nice!&rsquo; said Constance.&nbsp; &lsquo;And it is 
for the Church and Almighty God&rsquo;s service?&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 127--><a name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
127</span>&lsquo;Some of it,&rsquo; said Rose, &lsquo;but there&rsquo;s a 
good deal only for dresses, and furniture, and screens.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you feel like Sunday when you are doing altar-cloths 
and stools?&rsquo; asked Constance reverently.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I wish I did,&rsquo; said Rose; &lsquo;but I don&rsquo;t do much 
of that kind yet, and one can&rsquo;t keep up the being serious over it 
always, you know.&nbsp; Indeed, Miss Grey does not wish us to be dull; she 
reads to us when there is time, and explains the symbols that have to be 
done; but part of the time it is an amusing book, and she says she does not
mind cheerful talk, only she trusts us not to have gossip she would not 
like to hear.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I wonder,&rsquo; said Constance, &lsquo;whether I should have 
come with you if all this had not happened?&nbsp; It must be very 
nice.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But your school is nice?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh yes.&nbsp; I do love study, and those Saturdays and Sundays at
Northmoor, they are delicious!&nbsp; Uncle Frank reads with me about 
religion, you know.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Like our dear Bible class?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes; I never understood or felt anything before; he puts it so as
it comes home,&rsquo; said Constance, striving to express herself.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;Then I have a dear little class at the Sunday school.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am to have one, by and by.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mine are sweet little things, and I work for them on Saturdays, 
while Aunt Mary reads to me.&nbsp; I do like teaching&mdash;and, do you 
know, Rose, I think I shall be a High School teacher!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, Conny, I thought you were all so rich and grand!&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 128--><a name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
128</span>&lsquo;No, we are not,&rsquo; said Constance lazily; &lsquo;we 
have nothing but what Uncle Frank gives us, and I can&rsquo;t bear the way 
mamma and Ida are always trying to get more out of him, when I know he 
can&rsquo;t always do what he likes, and nasty people think him 
shabby.&nbsp; I am sure I ought to work for myself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But if Herbert is a lord?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I hope he won&rsquo;t be for a long long time,&rsquo; cried 
Constance.&nbsp; &lsquo;Besides, I am sure he would want all his money for 
himself!&nbsp; And as to being a teacher, Aunt Mary was, and Miss Arden, 
who is so wise and good, is one.&nbsp; If I was like them I think it would 
be doing real work for God and good&mdash;wouldn&rsquo;t it, Rose?&nbsp; Oh
dear, oh dear, there&rsquo;s the carriage stopping for you!&rsquo;</p>

THE DOLOMITES</h2>
<p>The summer was a very hot one, and the travellers, in spite of the charm
of new scenes, and the wonders of everything to their unsophisticated eyes,
found it trying.&nbsp; Constance indeed was in a state of constant felicity
and admiration, undimmed except by the flagging of her two 
fellow-travellers in the heated and close German railway cars.&nbsp; Her 
uncle&rsquo;s head suffered much, and Lady Northmoor secretly thought her 
maid&rsquo;s refusal to accompany them showed her to be a prudent 
woman.&nbsp; However, the first breath of mountain air was a grand revival 
to Lord Northmoor, and at Innsbruck he was quite alive, and walked about in
fervent delight, not desisting till he and Constance had made out every 
statue on Maximilian&rsquo;s monument.&nbsp; His wife was so much tired and
worn-out, that she heartily rejoiced in having provided him with such a 
good little companion, though she was disappointed at being obliged to fail
him, and get what rest she could at the hotel.&nbsp; But then, as she told 
him, if he learnt his way about it now, he would be able <!-- page 130--><a
name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 130</span>to show it all to her
when they had both gained strength at Ratzes.</p>
<p>Bertha had obtained full instructions and a welcome for them from Mrs. 
Bury, a kindly person, who, having married off her children while still in 
full health and vigour, remained at the service of any relation who needed 
her, and in the meantime resorted to out-of-the-way places abroad.</p>
<p>The railway took them to Botzen, which was hotter still, and thence on 
to Castelruth, whence there was no means of reaching Ratzes but by mule or 
<i>chaise &agrave; porteux</i>.&nbsp; Both alike were terrible to poor 
Mary; however, she made up her mind to the latter, and all the long way was
to her a dream of terror and discomfort, and of trying to admire&mdash;what
she knew she ought to admire&mdash;the wonderful pinnacle-like aiguilles of
the Schern cleaving the air.&nbsp; For some time the way lay over the great
plateau of the Scisser Alp&mdash;a sea of rich grass, full of cattle, where
her husband and niece kept on trying to bring their mules alongside of her 
to make her participate in their ecstasy, and partake of their 
spoils&mdash;mountain pink, celestially blue gentian, brilliant poppy, or 
the like.&nbsp; Here the principal annoyance was that their mules were so 
obstinately bent on not approaching her that she was in constant alarm for 
them, while Constance was absolutely wild with delight, and even grave 
Frank was exhilarated by the mountain air into boyish spirits, such as 
impressed her, though she resolutely prevented herself from lowering them 
by manifesting want of sympathy, though the aiguilles that they <!-- page 
131--><a name="page131"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 131</span>admired 
seemed to her savage, and the descent, along a perilous winding road, cut 
out among precipices, horrified her&mdash;on, on, through endless pine 
forests, where the mules insisted on keeping her in solitude, and where 
nothing could be seen beyond the rough jolting path.&nbsp; At last, when a 
whole day had gone by, and even Constance sat her mule in silence and 
looked very tired, the fir trees grew more scanty.&nbsp; The aiguilles 
seemed in all their wildness to be nodding overhead; there was a small 
bowling-green, a sort of ch&acirc;let in two divisions, united by a 
gallery: but Mary saw no more, for at that moment a loose slippery stone 
gave way, and the bearers stumbled and fell, dragging the chair so that it 
tipped over.</p>
<p>Constance, who had ridden on in front with her uncle, first heard a cry 
of dismay, and as both leaped off and rushed back, they saw her aunt had 
fallen, and partly entangled in the chair.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do not touch her!&rsquo; cried Frank, forgetting that he could 
not be understood, and raising her in his arms, as the chair was withdrawn;
but she did not speak or move, and there was a distressing throng and 
confusion of strange voices, seeming to hem them in as Constance looked 
round, unable to call up a single word of German, or to understand the 
exclamations.&nbsp; Then, as she always said, it was like an angel&rsquo;s 
voice that said, &lsquo;What is it?&rsquo; as through the crowd came a tall
lady in a white hat and black gown, and knelt down by the prostrate figure,
saying, &lsquo;I hope she is only stunned; let us carry her in.&nbsp; It 
will be better to let her come round there.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 132--><a name="page132"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
132</span>The lady gave vigorous aid, and, giving a few orders in German, 
helped Lord Northmoor to carry the inanimate form into the hotel, a low 
building of stone, with a high-pitched shingle roof.&nbsp; Constance 
followed in a bewilderment of fright, together with Lenchen, the Swiss 
maid, who, as well as could be made out, was declaring that a Swiss bearer 
never made a false step.</p>
<p>Lady Northmoor was carried into a bedroom, and Constance was shut out 
into a room that photographed itself on her memory, even in that 
moment&mdash;a room like a box, with a rough table, a few folding-chairs, 
an easel, water-coloured drawings hung about in all directions, a big 
travelling-case, a few books, a writing-case, Mrs. Bury&rsquo;s 
sitting-room in fact, which, as a regular sojourner, she had been able to 
secure and furnish after her need.&nbsp; From the window, tall, narrow, 
latticed, with a heavy outside shutter, she saw a village green, a little 
church with a sharp steeple, and pointed-roof houses covered with shingle, 
groups of people, a few in picturesque Tyrolese costume, but others in the 
ordinary badly cut edition of cosmopolitan human nature.&nbsp; There was a 
priest in a big hat and white bordered bands discussing a newspaper with a 
man with a big red umbrella; a party drinking coffee under a pine tree, and
beyond, those strange wild pointed aiguilles pointing up purple and red 
against the sky.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p132.jpg">
<img alt="There was a priest in a big hat . . ." src="images/p132.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>How delightful it would all have been if this quarter of an hour could 
be annihilated!&nbsp; She could find out nothing.&nbsp; Lenchen and the 
good-natured-looking landlady came in and out and fetched <!-- page 
133--><a name="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 133</span>things, but 
they never stayed long enough to give her any real information, the 
landlady shouting for &lsquo;Hemzel,&rsquo; etc., and Lenchen calling 
loudly in German for the boxes, which had been slung on mules.&nbsp; She 
heard nothing definite till her uncle came out, looking pale and 
anxious.</p>
<p>&lsquo;She is better now,&rsquo; he said, with a gasp of relief, 
throwing himself into a chair, and holding out his hand to Constance, who 
could hardly frame her question.&nbsp; &lsquo;Yes, quite 
sensible&mdash;came round quickly.&nbsp; The blow on the head seems to be 
of no consequence; but there may be a strain, or it may be only the being 
worn out and overdone.&nbsp; They are going to undress her and put her to 
bed now.&nbsp; Mrs. Bury is kindness itself.&nbsp; I did not look after her
enough on that dreadful road.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Isn&rsquo;t there a doctor?&rsquo; Constance ventured to ask.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No such thing within I know not how many miles of these 
paths!&nbsp; But Mrs. Bury seems to think it not likely to be needed.&nbsp;
Over-fatigue and the shake!&nbsp; What was I about?&nbsp; This air and all 
the rest were like an intoxication, making me forget my poor 
Mary!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He passed his hand over his face with a gesture as if he were very much 
shocked and grieved at himself, and Constance suggested that it was all the
mule&rsquo;s fault, and Aunt Mary never complained.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The more reason she should not have been neglected,&rsquo; he 
said; and it was well for the excluded pair that just then the boxes were 
reported as arrived, and he was called on for the keys, so <!-- page 
134--><a name="page134"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 134</span>that wild 
searching for things demanded occupied them.</p>
<p>After a considerable time, Mrs. Bury came and told Lord Northmoor that 
he might go and look at his wife for a few moments, but that she must be 
kept perfectly quiet and not talked to or agitated.&nbsp; Constance was not
to go in at all, but was conducted off by the good lady to her own tiny 
room, to get herself ready for the much-needed meal that was imminent.</p>
<p>They met again in the outer room.&nbsp; There was a great Speise saal, a
separate building, where the bathers dived <i>en masse</i>; but since Mrs. 
Bury had made the place her haunt, she had led to the erection of an 
additional building where there was a little accommodation for the 
travellers of the better class who had of late discovered the glories of 
the Dolomites, though the baths were scarcely ever used except by artizans 
and farmers.&nbsp; She had this sitting-room chiefly made at her own 
expense with these few comforts, in the way of easy folding-chairs, a vase 
of exquisite flowers on the table, a few delicate carvings, an easel, and 
drawings of the mountain peaks and ravines suspended everywhere.</p>
<p>Besides this there were only the bedrooms, as small as they well could 
be.</p>
<p>They were summoned down to the evening meal, and the maid Lenchen was 
left with Lady Northmoor.&nbsp; There was only one other guest, a 
spectacled and rather silent German, and Constance presently gathered that 
Mrs. Bury was trying to encourage and inspirit Lord Northmoor, but seemed 
to think <!-- page 135--><a name="page135"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
135</span>there might be some delay before a move would be possible.</p>
<p>They sent her to bed, for she was really very tired after the long walk 
and ride, and she could not help sleeping soundly; but the first thing she 
heard in the morning was that the guide had been desired to send a doctor 
from Botzen, and the poor child spent a dreary morning of anxiety with 
nothing to do but to watch the odd figures disporting themselves or resting
in the shade after their baths, to try a little sketching and a little 
letter-writing, but she was too restless and anxious to get on with 
either.</p>
<p>All the comfort she got was now and then Mrs. Bury telling her that she 
need not be frightened, and giving her a book to read; and after the midday
meal her uncle was desired by Mrs. Bury, who had evidently assumed the 
management of him, to take the child out walking, for the doctor could not 
come for hours, and Lady Northmoor had better be left to sleep.</p>
<p>So they wandered out into the pinewoods, preoccupied and silent, gazing 
along the path, as if that would hasten the doctor.&nbsp; Constance had 
perceived that questions were discouraged, and did her best to keep from 
being troublesome by trying to busy herself with a bouquet of mountain 
flowers.</p>
<p>The little German doctor came so late that he had to remain all night, 
but his coming, as well as that of a brisk American brother and sister, 
seemed to have cheered things up a good deal.&nbsp; Mrs. Bury talked to the
German, and the <!-- page 136--><a name="page136"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 136</span>Americans asked so many questions that 
answering them made things quite lively.&nbsp; Indeed, Constance was 
allowed to wish her aunt good-night, and seeing her look just like herself 
on her pillows, much relieved her mind.</p>

137</span>CHAPTER XX<br />
RATZES</h2>
<p>Things began to fall into their regular course at Ratzes, Lady Northmoor
was in a day or two able to come into Mrs. Bury&rsquo;s sitting-room for a 
few hours every day; but there she lay on a folding chaise-longue that had 
been arranged for her, languid but bright, reading, working, looking at 
Mrs. Bury&rsquo;s drawings, and keeping the diary of the adventures of the 
others.</p>
<p>Her husband would fain never have left her, but he had to take his 
baths.&nbsp; These were in the lower story of the larger 
ch&acirc;let.&nbsp; They were taken in rows of pinewood boxes in the 
vault.&nbsp; He muttered that it felt very like going alive into his 
coffin, when, like others, he laid himself down in the rust-coloured 
liquid, &lsquo;each in his narrow cell&rsquo; in iron &lsquo;laid,&rsquo; 
with his head on a shelf, and a lid closing up to his chin, and he was 
uncheered by conversation, as all the other patients were Austrians of the 
lower middle class, and their Tyrolean dialect would have been hard to 
understand even by German scholars.&nbsp; However, the treatment <!-- page 
138--><a name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 138</span>certainly 
did him good, and entirely drove away his neuralgia, he walked, rode, and 
climbed a good deal with Constance and a lad attached to the establishment,
whose German Constance could just understand.&nbsp; And while he stayed 
with his wife, Mrs. Bury took Constance out, showed her many delights, 
helped her crude notions of drawing, and being a good botanist herself, 
taught the whole party fresh pleasures in the wonderful flora of the 
Dolomites.</p>
<p>Now and then an English traveller appeared, and Lord Northmoor was 
persuaded to join in expeditions for his niece&rsquo;s sake, that took them
away for a night or two.&nbsp; Thus they saw Caprile Cadore, St. Ulrich, 
that town of toys, full of dolls of every tone, spotted wooden horses, 
carts, and the like.&nbsp; They beheld the tall points of Monte Serrata, 
and the wonderful &lsquo;Horse Teeth,&rsquo; with many more such marvels; 
and many were the curiosities they brought back, and the stories they had 
to tell, with regrets that Aunt Mary had not been there to enjoy and add to
their enjoyment.</p>
<p>So the days went on, and the end of Constance&rsquo;s holidays was in 
view, the limit that had been intended for the Kur at Ratzes; but Aunt Mary
had not been out of doors since their arrival, and seemed fit for nothing 
save lying by the window.</p>
<p>Constance had begun to wonder what would be done, when she was told that
a good-natured pair of English travellers, like herself bound to school 
terms, would escort her safely to London and see her into the train for 
Colbeam, just in time for the High School term.</p>
<p>&lsquo;This will be the best way,&rsquo; said her aunt, kissing <!-- 
page 139--><a name="page139"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
139</span>her.&nbsp; &lsquo;You have been a dear good girl, Conny, and a 
great pleasure and comfort to us both.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, auntie, I have not done anything, Mrs. Bury has done it 
all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mrs. Bury is most kind, unspeakably kind, but, my dear dear girl,
your companionship has been so much to your dear uncle that I have been 
most thankful to you.&nbsp; Always recollect, dearest Conny, you can be 
more comfort to your uncle than anybody else, whatever may come.&nbsp; You 
<i>will</i> always be a good girl and keep up your tone, and make him your 
great consideration&mdash;after higher things; promise me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh yes, indeed, auntie dear,&rsquo; said the girl, somewhat 
frightened and bewildered as the last kisses and good-byes were 
exchanged.&nbsp; Since the travellers were to start very early the next 
morning on their mules for Botzen, whither Mrs. Bury meant to accompany 
them in order to make some purchases, Lord Northmoor went with the party to
the limits of his walking powers, and on the slope of the Alp, amid the 
fir-woods, took his leave, Mrs. Bury telling him cheerfully that she should
return the next day, while he said that he could not thank her 
enough.&nbsp; He bade farewell to his niece, telling her that he hoped she 
would by and by be spending her holidays at Northmoor if all went well.</p>
<p>Constance had begun to grow alarmed, and watched for an opportunity of 
imploring Mrs. Bury to tell her whether Aunt Mary were really very ill.</p>
<p>Mrs. Bury laughed, and confided to her a secret, which made her at once 
glad, alarmed, and important.</p>
<p><!-- page 140--><a name="page140"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
140</span>&lsquo;Oh, and is no one to know?&rsquo; said little Constance, 
with rosy cheeks.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not till leave is given,&rsquo; said Mrs. Bury.&nbsp; &lsquo;You 
see there is still so much risk of things going wrong, that they both wish 
nothing to be said at present.&nbsp; I thought they had spoken to 
you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh no.&nbsp; But&mdash;but&mdash;&rsquo; and Constance could not 
go on, as her eyes filled with tears.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is there special cause for anxiety, you mean, my dear?&nbsp; 
Hardly for <i>her</i>, though it was unlucky that she was as unknowing as 
you, and I don&rsquo;t see how she is to be taken over these roads into a 
more civilised place.&nbsp; But I shall stay on and see them through with 
it, and I daresay we shall do very well.&nbsp; I am used enough to looking 
after my own daughters, and nobody particularly wants me at 
home.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s what Aunt Mary meant by saying you were <i>so</i> 
very good!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, it would be sheer inhumanity to leave them to themselves, 
and the mercies of Ratzes, and there seems to be no one else that could 
come.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m glad I know!&rsquo; said Constance, with a long 
breath.&nbsp; &lsquo;Only what shall I do if any one asks me about 
her?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Say she had a nasty fall, which makes it undesirable to move her 
just yet.&nbsp; It is the simple truth, and what you would have naturally 
said but for this little communication of mine.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I suppose,&rsquo; said Constance, in a tone Mrs. Bury did not 
understand, &lsquo;it will be all known before my Christmas 
holidays?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh yes, my dear, long before that.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll write to you 
when I have anything to tell.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 141--><a name="page141"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
141</span>For which Constance thanked her heartily, and thenceforth felt a 
great deal older for the confidence, which delighted as well as made her 
anxious, for she was too fond of her uncle and aunt, as well as too young 
and simple, for it to have occurred to her how the matter might affect her 
brother.</p>
<p>After seeing much more on her road than she had done before, and won 
golden opinions from her escort for intelligence and obligingness, she was 
safely deposited in the train for Colbeam, without having gone home.</p>
<p>She had made up her mind to pass Sunday at her boarding-house, and was 
greatly surprised when Lady Adela called on Saturday to take her to 
Northmoor for the Sunday.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now tell me about your uncle and aunt,&rsquo; the good lady 
began, when Constance was seated beside her.&nbsp; &lsquo;Yes, I have heard
from Mrs. Bury, but I want to know whether the place is tolerably 
comfortable.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mrs. Bury has made it much better,&rsquo; said Constance.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;And it is so beautiful, no one would care for comfort who was quite 
well.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And is your uncle well?&nbsp; Has he got over his 
headaches?&rsquo; she asked solicitously.</p>
<p>In fact, the absence of Lord and Lady Northmoor had done more than their
presence to make Lady Adela feel their value.&nbsp; She was astonished to 
find how much she missed the power of referring to him and leaning on his 
support in all questions, small or great, that cropped up; and she had 
begun to feel that the stick might be a staff; besides which, having 
imbibed more than an inkling of the cause <!-- page 142--><a 
name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 142</span>of detention, she was
anxious to gather what she could of the circumstances.</p>
<p>She was agreeably surprised in Constance, to whom the journey had been a
time of development from the mere school girl, and who could talk 
pleasantly, showing plenty of intelligence and observation in a modest 
ladylike way.&nbsp; Moreover, she had a game in the garden which little 
Amice enjoyed extremely, and she and her little Sunday class were delighted
to see one another again.&nbsp; It resulted in her Sundays being spent at 
Northmoor as regularly as before, and in Amice, a companionless child, 
thinking Saturday brought the white afternoon of the week.</p>

THE HEIR-APPARENT</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">My Dear Addie</span>,</p>
<p>&lsquo;You have no doubt ceased from your exertions in the way of 
finding nurses, since the telegram has told you that the son and heir has 
considerately saved trouble and expense by making his appearance on 
Michaelmas morning.&nbsp; It was before there was time to fetch anybody but
the ancient village Bettina.&nbsp; Everything is most prosperous, and I am 
almost as proud as the parents&mdash;and to see them gloat over the morsel 
is a caution.&nbsp; They look at him as if such a being had never been 
known on the earth before; and he really is a very fine healthy creature, 
most ridiculously like the portrait of the original old Michael Morton 
Northmoor in the full-bottomed wig.&nbsp; He seems to be almost equally 
marvellous to the Ratzes population, being the first infant seen there 
unswaddled&mdash;or washed.&nbsp; Bettina&rsquo;s horror at the idea of 
washing him is worth seeing.&nbsp; Her brown old face was almost convulsed,
and she and our Frau-wirthin concurred in assuring me that it would be <!--
page 144--><a name="page144"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 144</span>fatal 
to <i>der kleine baron</i> if he were washed, except with white wine and 
milk at a fortnight old; nor would they accept my assurance that my three 
daughters and seven grandchildren had survived the process.&nbsp; I have to
do it myself, and dress him as I can, for his wardrobe as made here is not 
complete, and whatever you can send us will be highly acceptable.&nbsp; It 
is lucky that Northmoor is a born nurse, for the women&rsquo;s fear of 
breaking the child is really justifiable, as they never handled anything 
not made up into a mummy; moreover, they wish to let all the world up into 
Mary&rsquo;s room to behold the curiosity, I met the priest upon his way 
and turned him back!&nbsp; So we have pretty well all the nursing on our 
hands, and happily it is of the most satisfactory kind, with the one 
drawback that we have to call in the services of a &lsquo;valia&rsquo;; but
on the other hand we have all been so much interested in a poor little 
widow, Hedwig Grantzen, whose husband was lost last spring in a snow-storm,
that it is pleasant to have some employment for her.&nbsp; Such a creature 
as came over on chance and speculation&mdash;a great coarse handsome girl, 
in exaggerated costume, all new, with lacy ribbons down her back; but I 
rode over to Botzen, and interviewed her parish priest about her, and that 
was enough to settle her.&nbsp; Every one is asleep except myself, and 
Mary&rsquo;s face is one smile as she sleeps.</p>
<p>&lsquo;This is going to be posted by the last of the tourists, luckily a
clergyman, whom we begged to baptize the boy, as there is a possibility 
that snows may close us in before we can get away.</p>
<p>&lsquo;So he is named Michael Kenton, partly after <!-- page 145--><a 
name="page145"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 145</span>my own dear brother 
as well as the old founder, partly in honour of the day and of Sir Edward 
Kenton, who, they say, has been their very kind friend.&nbsp; It really is 
a feast to see people so wonderingly happy and thankful.&nbsp; The little 
creature has all the zest of novelty to them, and they coo and marvel over 
it in perfect felicity.&nbsp; When you will be introduced to the hero, I 
cannot guess, for though he has been an earlier arrival than his 
mother&rsquo;s inexperience expected, I much doubt her being able to get 
out of this place while the way to Botzen is passable according to the 
prognostics of the sages.&nbsp; What splendid studies of ice peaks I shall 
have!&nbsp; Your affectionate cousin,</p>

<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<span class="smcap">L. 
Bury</span>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>A telegram had preceded the letter.&nbsp; One soon followed by Mrs. 
Bury&rsquo;s promised note had filled Constance&rsquo;s honest little heart
with rapture, another had set all the bells in Northmoor Church ringing and
Best rejoicing that &lsquo;that there Harbut&rsquo;s nose was put out of 
joint,&rsquo; a feeling wherein Lady Adela could not but participate, 
though, of course, she showed no sign of it to Constance.&nbsp; A 
sharply-worded letter to the girl soon came from her mother, demanding what
she had known beforehand.&nbsp; Mrs. Morton had plainly been quite 
unprepared for what was a severe blow to her, and it was quite possible to 
understand how, in his shyness, Lord Northmoor had put off writing of the 
hope and expectation from day to day till all had been fulfilled sooner 
than had been expected.</p>
<p>It was the first thing that brought home to <!-- page 146--><a 
name="page146"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 146</span>Constance that the 
event was scarcely as delightful to her family as to herself.&nbsp; She 
wrote what she knew and heard no more, for none of her home family were apt
to favour her with much correspondence.&nbsp; Miss Morton, however, had 
written to her sister-in-law.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Poor Herbert!&nbsp; I am sorry for him, though you won&rsquo;t 
be.&nbsp; He takes it very well, he really is a very good sort at bottom, 
and it really is the very best thing for him, as I have been trying to 
persuade him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Bulletins came with tolerable frequency from Ratzes, with all good 
accounts of mother and child, and a particular description of little 
Michael&rsquo;s beauties; but it was only too soon announced that snow was 
falling, and this was soon followed by another letter saying that 
consultation with the best authorities within reach had decided that unless
the weather were extraordinarily mild, the journey, after November set in, 
was not to be ventured by Lady Northmoor or so young a child.&nbsp; There 
would be perils for any one, even the postmen and the guides, and if it 
were mild in one valley it might only render it more dangerous over the 
next Alp.&nbsp; Still Mrs. Bury, a practised and enterprising mountaineer, 
might have attempted it; but though Mary was rapidly recovering and the 
language was no longer utterly impracticable, the good lady could not bear 
to desert her charges, or to think what might happen to them, if left 
alone, in case of illness or accident, so she devoted herself to them and 
to her studies of ice and snow, and wrote word to her family that they were
to think of her as hibernating till Easter, if not Whitsuntide.</p>

147</span>CHAPTER XXII<br />
OUT OF JOINT</h2>
<p>Constance had, of course, to spend her Christmas holidays at home, where
she had not been for nine months.</p>
<p>Her brother met her at the London terminus to go down with her, and 
there, to her great joy, she also saw Rose Rollstone on the platform.&nbsp;
Herbert, whose dignity had first prompted him to seek a smoking carriage 
apart from his sister, thereupon decided to lay it aside and enter with 
them, looking rather scornful at the girls&rsquo; mutual endearments.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Come, Conny, Miss Rollstone has had enough of that,&rsquo; he 
said, &lsquo;and here are a lot going to get in.&nbsp; Oh my, the 
cads!&nbsp; I shall have to get into the smoking carriage after 
all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, don&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Sit opposite and we shall do very 
well.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Then came the exchange of news, and&mdash;&lsquo;You&rsquo;ve heard, of 
course, Rosie?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I should think I had,&rsquo; then an anxious glance at Herbert, 
who answered&mdash;</p>
<p><!-- page 148--><a name="page148"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
148</span>&lsquo;Oh yes, mother and Ida have been tearing their hair ever 
since, but it is all rot!&nbsp; The governor&rsquo;s very welcome to the 
poor little beggar!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s right!&nbsp; That&rsquo;s very noble of you, 
Herbert,&rsquo; said both the girls in a breath.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, you see, old Frank is good to live these thirty or forty 
years yet, and what was the good of having to wait?&nbsp; Better have done 
with it at once, I say, and he has written me a stunning jolly 
letter.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, I was sure he would!&rsquo; cried Constance.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m to go on just the same, and he won&rsquo;t cut off my 
allowance,&rsquo; pursued Herbert.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is just as my papa says,&rsquo; put in Rose, &lsquo;he is 
always the gentleman.&nbsp; And you&rsquo;ll be in the army 
still?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;When I&rsquo;ve got through my exams; but they are no joke, Miss 
Rose, I can tell you.&nbsp; It is Conny there that likes to sap.&nbsp; What
have you been doing this time, little one?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know yet, but Miss Astley thinks I have done well 
and shall get into the upper form,&rsquo; said Constance shyly.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;I got on with my German while I was abroad, trying to teach Uncle 
Frank.&rsquo;</p>
<p>At which Herbert laughed heartily, and demanded what sort of scholar he 
made.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not very good,&rsquo; owned Constance; &lsquo;he did forget so 
from day to day, and he asked so many questions, and was always wanting to 
have things explained.&nbsp; But it made me know them better, and Mrs. Bury
had such nice books, and she helped me.&nbsp; If you want to take up French
and German, Bertie&mdash;</p>
<p><!-- page 149--><a name="page149"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
149</span>He shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t spoil the passing hour, child.&nbsp; I should think 
you would be glad enough to get away from it all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I do want to get on,&rsquo; said Constance.&nbsp; &lsquo;I must, 
you know, more than ever now.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, you mean that mad fancy of going and being a 
teacher?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is not a bit mad, Herbert.&nbsp; Rose does not think it is, 
and I want you to stand by me if mamma and Ida make objections.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Girls are always in such a hurry,&rsquo; grumbled Herbert.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;You need not make a stir about it yet.&nbsp; You won&rsquo;t be able
to begin for ever so long.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Rose agreed with him that it would be much wiser not to broach the 
subject till Constance was old enough to begin the preparation, though, 
with the impatience of youth to express its designs and give them form, she
did not like the delay.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I tell you what, Con,&rsquo; finally said Herbert, &lsquo;if you 
set mother and Ida worrying before their time, I shall vote it all rot, and
not say a word to help you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Which disposed of the subject for the time, and left them to discuss 
happily Constance&rsquo;s travels and Herbert&rsquo;s new tutor and 
companions till their arrival at Westhaven, where Constance&rsquo;s welcome
was quite a secondary thing to Herbert&rsquo;s, as she well knew it would 
be, nor felt it as a grievance, though she was somewhat amazed at seeing 
him fervently embraced, and absolutely cried over, with &lsquo;Oh, my poor 
injured boy!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Herbert did not like it at all, and disengaging <!-- page 150--><a 
name="page150"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 150</span>himself rapidly, 
growled out his favourite expletive of &lsquo;Rot!&nbsp; Have done with 
that!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He was greatly admired for his utter impatience of commiseration, but 
there was no doubt that the disappointment was far greater to his mother 
and Ida than to himself.&nbsp; He cared little for what did not make any 
actual difference to his present life, whereas to them the glory and honour
of his heirship and the future hopes were everything&mdash;and 
Constance&rsquo;s manifest delight in the joy of her uncle and aunt, and 
her girlish interest in the baby, were to their eyes unfeeling folly, if 
not absolute unkindness to her brother.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dear little baby, indeed!&rsquo; said Ida scornfully.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;Nasty little wretch, I say.&nbsp; One good thing is, up in that cold
place all this time he&rsquo;s sure not to live.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Herbert whistled.&nbsp; &lsquo;That&rsquo;s coming it rather 
strong.&rsquo;&nbsp; And Constance, with tears starting to her eyes, said, 
&lsquo;For shame, Ida, how can you be so wicked!&nbsp; Think of Uncle Frank
and Aunt Mary!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I believe you care for them more than for your own flesh and 
blood!&rsquo; exclaimed her mother.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, and haven&rsquo;t they done a sight deal more for 
her?&rsquo; said Herbert.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You turning on me too, you ungrateful boy!&rsquo; cried Mrs. 
Morton.</p>
<p>Herbert laughed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If it comes to gratitude,&rsquo; he said, and looked 
significantly at the decorations.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And what is it but the due to his brother&rsquo;s widow?&rsquo; 
said Mrs. Morton.&nbsp; &lsquo;Just a pittance, and you may depend that 
will be cut down on some pretext now!&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 151--><a name="page151"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
151</span>&lsquo;I should think so, if they heard Ida&rsquo;s 
tongue!&rsquo; said Herbert.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And Constance there is spitefulness enough to go and tell 
them&mdash;favourite as she is!&rsquo; said Ida.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I should think not!&rsquo; said Constance indignantly.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;As if I would do such a mean thing!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Come, come, Ida,&rsquo; said her mother, &lsquo;your sister knows
better than that.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s not the way when she is only just come 
home, so grown too and improved, &ldquo;quite the lady.&rdquo;&lsquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Morton had a mother&rsquo;s heart for Constance, though only in the
third degree, and was really gratified to see her progress.&nbsp; She had 
turned up her pretty brown hair, and the last year had made her much less 
of a child in appearance; her features were of delicate mould, she had dark
eyes, and a sweet mouth, with a rose-blush complexion, and was pleasing to 
look on, though, in her mother&rsquo;s eyes, no rival to the thin, rather 
sharply-defined features, bright eyes, and pink-and-white complexion that 
made Ida the belle of a certain set at Westhaven.&nbsp; The party were more
amicable over the dinner-table&mdash;for dinner it was called, as an 
assertion of gentility.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Are you allowed to dine late,&rsquo; asked Ida patronisingly of 
her sister, &lsquo;when you are not at school?</p>
<p>&lsquo;Lady Adela dines early,&rsquo; said Constance.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, for your sake, I suppose?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Always, I believe,&rsquo; said Constance.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, always,&rsquo; said Herbert.&nbsp; &lsquo;Fine people 
needn&rsquo;t ask what&rsquo;s genteel, you see, Ida.&rsquo;</p>
<p>That was almost the only breeze, and after dinner Herbert rushed out for
a smell of sea, <!-- page 152--><a name="page152"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 152</span>interspersed with pipe, and to &lsquo;look up 
the inevitable old Jack.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Constance was then subjected to a cross-examination on all the 
circumstances of the detention at Ratzes, and all she had heard or ought to
have heard about the arrival of the unwelcome little Michael, while her 
mother and sister drew their own inferences.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Really,&rsquo; said Ida at last, &lsquo;it is just like a thing 
in a book.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Constance was surprised.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Because it was such a happy surprise for them,&rsquo; she added 
hastily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, nonsense, child, but it is just what they always do when they
want a supposititious heir.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ida, how can you say such things?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But it is, Conny!&nbsp; There was the wicked Sir Ronald 
Macronald.&nbsp; He took his wife away to Belgrade, right in the Ukraine 
mountains, and it&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Belgrade is in Hungary, and the Cossacks live in the Ukraine in 
Russia,&rsquo; suggested Constance.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, never mind your school-girl geography, it was Bel something, 
an out-of-the-way place in the mountains anyway, and there he pretended she
had a child, just out of malice to the right heiress, that lovely Lilian, 
and he got killed by a stag, and then she confessed on her death-bed.&nbsp;
I declare it is just like&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My dear, don&rsquo;t talk in that way, your sister is quite 
shocked.&nbsp; Your uncle never would&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Bless me, ma, I was only in fun.&nbsp; I could tell you ever so 
many stories like that.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s Broughton&rsquo;s, on the table
there.&nbsp; I knew from the <!-- page 153--><a name="page153"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 153</span>first it was an impostor, and the old nurse 
dressed like a nun was his mother.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I believe you always know the end before you are half through the
first volume,&rsquo; said her mother admiringly; &lsquo;but of course it is
all right, only it is a terrible disappointment and misfortune for us, and 
not to be looked for after all these years.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The last three Christmastides had been spent at Northmoor, where it had 
been needful to conform to the habits of the household, which impressed Ida
and her mother as grand and conferring distinction, but decidedly dull and 
religious.</p>
<p>So as they were at Westhaven, perforce, they would make up for it, 
Christmas Eve was spent in a tumult of preparation for the diversions of 
the next day.&nbsp; Mrs. Morton had two maids now, but to her they were 
still &lsquo;gals,&rsquo; not to be trusted with the more delicate 
cookeries, and Ida was fully engaged in the adornment of the room and 
herself, while Constance ran about and helped both, and got more thanks 
from her mother than her sister.</p>
<p>Ida was to end the day with a dance at a friend&rsquo;s house, but she 
was not desirous of taking Constance with her, having been accustomed to 
treat her as a mere child, and Constance, though not devoid of a wish for 
amusement, knew that her uncle and aunt would have taken her to church, 
where she would have enjoyed the festal service.</p>
<p>Her mother would not let her go out in the dark alone, and was too tired
to go with her, so she had to stay at home, while Herbert disported himself
elsewhere, and Constance underwent another cross-examination over the 
photographs she had brought <!-- page 154--><a name="page154"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 154</span>home, but Mrs. Morton was never unkind when 
alone with her, and she had all the natural delight of youth in relating 
her adventures.&nbsp; Mrs. Morton, however, showed offence at not having 
been sent for instead of Mrs. Bury.&mdash;&lsquo;So much less of a 
relation,&rsquo; and Constance found herself dwelling on the ruggedness of 
the pass, and the difficulties of making oneself understood, but Mrs. 
Morton still persisted that she &lsquo;could not understand why they should
have got into such a place at all, when there were plenty of fashionable 
places in the newspaper where they could have had society and attendance 
and everything.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, but that was just what Uncle Frank didn&rsquo;t 
want.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, if they choose to be so eccentric, and close and shy, they 
can&rsquo;t wonder that people talk.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mamma, you can&rsquo;t mean that horrid nonsense that Ida talked 
about!&nbsp; It was only a joke!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, my dear, I don&rsquo;t say that I suspect anything&mdash;oh 
no,&mdash;only, if they had not been so close and queer, one would have 
been able to contradict it.&nbsp; I like people to be straightforward, 
that&rsquo;s all I have to say.&nbsp; And it is terribly hard on your poor 
brother to be so disappointed, after having his expectations so 
raised!&rsquo; and Mrs. Morton melted into tears, leaving Constance with 
nothing to say, for in the first place, she did not think Herbert, as yet 
at least, was very sensible of his loss, and in the next, she did not quite
venture to ask her mother whether she thought little Michael should have 
been sacrificed to Herbert&rsquo;s expectations.&nbsp; So she took the 
wiser course of producing a photograph of Vienna.</p>
<h2><!-- page 155--><a name="page155"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
155</span>CHAPTER XXIII<br />
VELVET</h2>
<p>Constance created quite a sensation when she came down dressed for 
church on Christmas Day in a dark blue velvet jacket, deeply trimmed with 
silver fox, and a hat and muff <i>en suite</i>, matching with her serge 
dress, and though unpretending, yet very handsome.</p>
<p>Up jumped Ida, from lacing her boots by the fire.&nbsp; &lsquo;Well, I 
never!&nbsp; They are spoiling you!&nbsp; Real velvet, I declare, and real 
silk-wadded lining.&nbsp; Look, ma.&nbsp; What made them dress you like 
that?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It wasn&rsquo;t them,&rsquo; said Constance, &lsquo;it was Lady 
Adela.&nbsp; One Sunday in October it turned suddenly cold, and I had only 
my cloth jacket, and she sent up for something warm for me.&nbsp; This was 
just new before she went into black, when husband died, and she had put it 
away for Amice, but it fitted me so well, and looked so nice, that she was 
so kind as to wish me to keep it always.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Cast-off clothes!&nbsp; That&rsquo;s the insolence of these 
swells,&rsquo; said Ida.&nbsp; &lsquo;I wonder you had not the spirit to 
refuse.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 156--><a name="page156"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
156</span>&lsquo;Sour grapes,&rsquo; muttered Herbert; while her mother 
sighed&mdash;&lsquo;Ah, that&rsquo;s what we come to!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Must not I wear it, mamma?&rsquo; said Constance, who had a 
certain attachment to the beautiful and comfortable garment.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;She told me she had only worn it once in London, and she was so very
kind.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, if you call it kindness,&rsquo; said Ida, &lsquo;I call it 
impertinence.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If you had only heard&mdash;&rsquo; faltered Constance.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, no,&rsquo; said their mother, &lsquo;you could not refuse, of
course, my dear, and no one here will know.&nbsp; It becomes her very well 
too.&nbsp; Doesn&rsquo;t it, Ida?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ida made a snort.&nbsp; &lsquo;If people choose to make a little chit of
a schoolgirl ridiculous by dressing her out like that!&rsquo; she said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There isn&rsquo;t time now before church,&rsquo; said Constance 
almost tearfully, &lsquo;or I would take it off.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No such thing,&rsquo; said Herbert.&nbsp; &lsquo;Come on, 
Conny.&nbsp; You shall walk with me.&nbsp; You look stunning, and I want 
Westhaven folk to see for once what a lady is like.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Constance was very glad to be led away from Ida&rsquo;s comments, and 
resolved that her blue velvet should not see the light again at Westhaven; 
but she did not find this easy to carry out; for, perhaps for the sake of 
teasing Ida, Herbert used to inquire after it, and insist on her wearing 
it, and her mother liked to see her, and to show her, in it.&nbsp; It was 
only Ida who seemed unable to help saying something disagreeable, till, 
almost in despair, Constance offered to lend the bone of contention; but 
Lady Adela was a small woman, and Constance would never be on so large a 
scale as her sister, so that <!-- page 157--><a name="page157"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 157</span>the jacket refused to be transferred except at
the risk of being spoilt by alteration; and here Mrs. Morton interfered, 
&lsquo;It would never do to have them say at Northmoor that &ldquo;Lady 
Morton&rsquo;s&rdquo; gift had been spoilt by their meddling with 
it.&rsquo;&nbsp; Constance was glad, though she suspected that Lady Adela 
would never have found it out.</p>
<p>Then Ida consulted Sibyl Grover, who was working with a dressmaker, and 
with whom she kept up a sort of patronisingly familiar acquaintance, as to 
making something to rival it, and Sibyl was fertile in devices as to doing 
so cheaply, but when she consulted her superior, she was told that without 
the same expensive materials it would evidently be only an imitation, and 
moreover, that the fashion was long gone out of date.&nbsp; Which enabled 
Ida to bear the infliction with some degree of philosophy.</p>
<p>This jacket was not, however, Constance&rsquo;s only trouble.&nbsp; Her 
conscience was already uneasy at the impossibility of getting to evensong 
on Christmas Day.&nbsp; She had been to an early Celebration without asking
any questions, and had got back before Herbert had come down to breakfast, 
and very glad she was that she had done so, for she found that her mother 
regarded it as profane &lsquo;to take the Sacrament&rsquo; when she was 
going to have a party in the evening, and when Constance was in the midst 
of the party she felt that&mdash;if it were to be&mdash;her mother might be
right.</p>
<p>It was a dinner first&mdash;at which Constance did not 
appear&mdash;chiefly of older people, who talked of shipping and of 
coals.&nbsp; Afterwards, if they noticed the young people, joked them about
their imaginary <!-- page 158--><a name="page158"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 158</span>lovers&mdash;beaux, as the older ladies called
them; young men, as the younger ones said.&nbsp; One, the most plain spoken
of all, asked Herbert how he felt, at which the boy wriggled and laughed 
sheepishly, and his mother had a great confabulation with various of the 
ladies, who were probably condoling with her.</p>
<p>Later, there were cards for the elders, and sundry more young people 
came in for a dance.&nbsp; The Rollstones were considered as beneath the 
dignity of the Mortons, but Herbert had loudly insisted on inviting Rose 
for the evening and had had his way, but after all she would not 
come.&nbsp; Herbert felt himself aggrieved, and said she was as horrid a 
little prig as Constance, who on her side felt a pang of envy as she 
thought of Rose going to church and singing hymns and carols to her father 
and mother, while she, after a struggle under the mistletoe, which made her
hot and miserable, had to sit playing waltzes.&nbsp; One good-natured lady 
offered to relieve her, but she was too much afraid of the hero of the 
mistletoe to stir from her post, and the daughter of her kindly friend had 
no scruple in exclaiming&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh no, ma, don&rsquo;t!&nbsp; You always put us out, you know, 
and Constance Morton is as true as old Time.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am sure Constance is only too happy to oblige her 
friends,&rsquo; said Mrs. Morton.&nbsp; &lsquo;And she is not out 
yet,&rsquo; she added, as a tribute to high life.</p>
<p>If Constance at times felt unkindly neglected, at others she heard 
surges of giggling, and suppressed shrieking and protests that made her 
feel the piano an ark of refuge.</p>
<p><!-- page 159--><a name="page159"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
159</span>The parting speech from a good-natured old merchant captain was, 
&lsquo;Why, you demure little pussy cat, you are the prettiest of them 
all!&nbsp; What have yon lads been thinking about to let those little 
fingers be going instead of her feet?&nbsp; Or is it all Miss Ida&rsquo;s 
jealousy, eh?&rsquo;</p>
<p>All this, in a speaking-trumpet voice, put the poor child into an agony 
of blushes, which only incited him to pat her on the cheek, and the rest to
laugh hilariously, under the influence of negus and cheap champagne.</p>
<p>Constance could have cried for very shame, but when she was waiting on 
her mother, who, tired as she was, would not go to bed without locking up 
the spoons and the remains of the wine, Mrs. Morton said kindly, &lsquo;You
are tired, my dear, and no wonder.&nbsp; They were a little noisy 
to-night.&nbsp; Those are not goings-on that I always approve, you know, 
but young folk always like a little pleasure extra at Christmas.&nbsp; 
Don&rsquo;t you go and get too genteel for us, Conny.&nbsp; Come, come, 
don&rsquo;t cry.&nbsp; Drink this, my love, you&rsquo;re tired.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, mamma, it is not the being genteel&mdash;oh no, but Christmas
Day and all!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Come, come, my dear, I can&rsquo;t have you get mopy and dull; 
religion is a very good thing, but it isn&rsquo;t meant to hinder all 
one&rsquo;s pleasure, and when you&rsquo;ve been to church on a Christmas 
Day, what more can be expected of young people but to enjoy 
themselves?&nbsp; Come, go to bed and think no more about it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>To express or even to understand what she felt would have been 
impossible to Constance, so she <!-- page 160--><a name="page160"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 160</span>had to content herself with feeling warm at 
her heart, at her mother&rsquo;s kind kiss.</p>
<p>All the other parties she saw were much more decorous, even to 
affectation, except that at the old skipper&rsquo;s, and he was viewed by 
the family as a subject for toleration, because he had been a friend and 
messmate of Mrs. Morton&rsquo;s father.&nbsp; All the good side of that 
lady and Ida came out towards him and his belongings.&nbsp; He had an 
invalid granddaughter, with a spine complaint and feeble eyesight, and Ida 
spent much time in amusing her, teaching her fancy works and reading to 
her.&nbsp; Unluckily it was only trashy novels from the circulating library
that they read; Ida had no taste for anything else, and protested that 
Louie would be bored to death if she tried to read her the African 
adventures which were just then the subject of enthusiasm even with 
Herbert!&nbsp; Ida was not a dull girl.&nbsp; Unlike some who do not seem 
to connect their books with life, she made them her realities and lived in 
them, and as she hardly ever read anything more substantial her ideas of 
life and society were founded on them, though in her own house she was 
shrewd in practical matters, and though not strong was a useful active 
assistant to her mother whenever there was no danger of her being detected 
in doing anything derogatory to one so nearly connected with the 
peerage.</p>
<p>Indeed, she seemed to regard her sister&rsquo;s dutiful studies as 
proofs of dulness and want of spirit.&nbsp; She was quite angry when 
Constance objected to <i>The Unconscious Impostor</i>,&mdash;very yellow, 
with a truculent flaming design outside&mdash;that &lsquo;she did not think
she <!-- page 161--><a name="page161"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
161</span>ought to read that kind of book&mdash;Aunt Mary would not like 
it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, if I would be in bondage to an old governess!&nbsp; You are
not such a child now.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t, Ida.&nbsp; Uncle Frank would not like it 
either.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Perhaps not,&rsquo; said Ida, with an ugly, meaning laugh as she 
glanced again at the title.</p>
<p>Constance might really have liked to read more tales than she allowed 
herself.&nbsp; <i>The House on the Marsh</i> tempted her, but she was true 
to the advice she had received, and Rose Rollstone upheld her in her 
resolution.</p>
<p>Ida thought it rather &lsquo;low&rsquo; in Herbert and Constance to care
for the old butler&rsquo;s daughter, but their mother had a warm spot in 
the bottom of her heart, and liked a gossip with Mrs. Rollstone too much to
forbid the house to her daughter, besides that she shrank from inflicting 
on her so much distress.</p>
<p>So during the fortnight that Rose spent at home the girls were together 
most of the morning.&nbsp; After Constance, well wrapped up, had practised 
in the cold drawing-room, where economy forbade fires till the afternoon, 
she sped across to Rose in the little stuffy parlour where Mr. Rollstone 
liked to doze over his newspaper to the lullaby of their low-voiced 
chatter.&nbsp; Often they walked together, and were sometimes joined by 
Herbert, who on these occasions always showed that he knew how to behave 
like a gentleman.</p>
<p>Herbert was faithfully keeping his promise not to bet, though, as he 
observed, he had not expected <!-- page 162--><a name="page162"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 162</span>to be in for it so long.&nbsp; But it was 
satisfactory to hear that his present fellow-pupils did not go in for that 
sort of thing, and Constance felt sure that her uncle and aunt would be 
pleased with him and think him much improved.</p>

THE REVENGE OF SORDID SPIRITS</h2>
<p>&lsquo;I am quite convinced,&rsquo; said Ida Morton, &lsquo;it is quite 
plain why we are not invited.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My dear, you see what your aunt says; that Mrs. Bury&rsquo;s 
daughter&rsquo;s husband is ordered to India, and that having the whole 
family to stay at Northmoor gives them the only chance of being all 
together for a little while, and after their obligations to Mrs. 
Bury&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ma, how can you be so green?&nbsp; Obligations, indeed!&nbsp; It 
is all a mere excuse to say there is not room for us in that great 
house.&nbsp; I see through it all.&nbsp; It is just to prevent us from 
being able to ask inconvenient questions of the German nurse and Mrs. Bury 
and all!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, Ida, I wish you would put away that fancy.&nbsp; Your uncle 
and aunt were always such good people!&nbsp; And there was Mrs. 
Bury&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mother, you will never understand the revenge of sordid 
souls,&rsquo; said Ida tragically, quoting from <i>The Unconscious 
Impostor</i>.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Revenge!&nbsp; What can you mean?&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 164--><a name="page164"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
164</span>&lsquo;Of course, you know, Mrs. Bury never forgave 
Herbert&rsquo;s taking her for a tramp, and you know how nasty uncle was 
about that white rook and the bets.&nbsp; Oh, it is quite plain.&nbsp; He 
was to be deprived of his rights, and so this journey was contrived, and 
they got into this out-of-the-way, inaccessible place, and sent poor Conny 
away, and then had no doctor or nurse&mdash;exactly as people always 
do.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, Ida, only in stories!&nbsp; Your novels are turning your 
head.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Novels are transcripts of life,&rsquo; again said Ida, solemnly 
quoting.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t believe it if they put such things into your 
head,&rsquo; said her mother.&nbsp; &lsquo;Asking Herbert to be godfather 
too!&nbsp; Such a compliment!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;An empty compliment, to hoodwink us and the poor boy,&rsquo; said
Ida.&nbsp; &lsquo;No, no, ma, the keeping you away settles it in my mind, 
and it shall be the business of my life to unmask that!&rsquo;</p>
<p>So spoke Ida, conscious of being a future heroine.</p>
<p>It was quite true that Herbert had been asked to stand godfather to his 
little cousin&rsquo;s admission into the Church, after, of course, a very 
good report had been received from his tutor.&nbsp; &lsquo;You are the 
little fellow&rsquo;s nearest kinsman,&rsquo; wrote Lord Northmoor, 
&lsquo;and I trust to you to influence him for good.&rsquo;&nbsp; Herbert 
wriggled, blushed, thought he hated it, was glad it had been written 
instead of spoken, but was really touched.</p>
<p>His uncle had justly thought responsibility would be wholesome, and 
besides, Herbert represented to him his brother, for whom he had a very 
tender feeling.</p>
<p>It was quite true that Northmoor was as full as <!-- page 165--><a 
name="page165"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 165</span>it would hold.&nbsp; 
Mrs. Bury&rsquo;s eldest daughter was going out to India, and another had a
husband in the Civil Service; the third lived in Ireland, and the only way 
of having the whole family together for their last fortnight was to gather 
them at Northmoor, as soon as its lord and lady returned, nor had they been
able to escape from their Dolomite ravine till the beginning of May, for 
the roads were always dangerous, often impassable, so that there had been 
weeks when they were secluded from even the post, and had had difficulties 
as to food and fire.</p>
<p>However, it had done them no harm, and was often looked back upon as, 
metaphorically as well as literally, the brightest and whitest time in 
their lives.&nbsp; Frank had walked and climbed both with Mrs. Bury and on 
his own account, and had drunk in the wild glories of the mountain winter, 
and the fantastic splendours of snow and ice on those wondrous peaks.&nbsp;
And, with that new joy and delight to be found in the queer wooden cradle, 
his heart was free to bound as perhaps it had never done before, in 
exulting thankfulness, as he looked up to those foretastes of the Great 
White Throne.</p>
<p>Never had he had such a rest before from toil, care, and anxiety as in 
those months in the dry, bracing air, and it was the universal remark that 
Lord Northmoor came back years younger and twice the man he had been 
before, with a spirit of cheerfulness and enterprise such as had always 
been wanting; while as to his wife, she was less strong than before, but 
there was a certain peaceful, yet exulting happiness about her, and her 
face had gained wonderfully in sweetness and expression.</p>
<p><!-- page 166--><a name="page166"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
166</span>The child was a fine plump little fellow, old enough to laugh and
respond to loving faces and gestures.&nbsp; Mary had feared the sight might
be painful to Lady Adela, and was gratified to find her too true a 
baby-lover and too generous a spirit not to worship him almost as devotedly
as did Constance.</p>
<p>Perhaps the heads of the family had never seen or participated in 
anything like the domestic mirth and enjoyment of that fortnight&rsquo;s 
visit; Bertha was with Lady Adela, and the intimacy and confidence in which
Frank and Mary had lived with Mrs. Bury had demolished many barriers of 
shyness, and made them hosts who could be as one with their 
guests&mdash;guests with whom the shadow of parting made the last sunshine 
seem the more bright.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I did not know what I was letting you in for,&rsquo; said Bertha,
in apology to Mrs. Bury.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My dear, I would not have been without the experience on any 
account.&nbsp; I never saw such a refreshing pair of people.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Surely it must have been awfully slow&mdash;regular penal 
servitude!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You confuse absence of small talk with absence of soul, 
Birdie.&nbsp; When we had once grown intimate enough to hold our tongues if
we had nothing to say, we got on perfectly.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And what you had to say was about Master Michael?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not entirely; though I must say the mingled reverence and 
curiosity with which they regard the little monster, and their own fear of 
not bringing up their treasure properly, were a very interesting 
study.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 167--><a name="page167"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
167</span>&lsquo;More so than your snowy peaks!&nbsp; Ah, if the proper 
study of mankind is man, the proper study of womankind is babe.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, it was not at all an unsatisfactory study, in this 
case.&nbsp; And let me tell you, Miss Birdie, it is no bad thing to be shut
in for a few months with a few good books and a couple of thoroughly 
simple-hearted people, who have thought a good deal in their quiet humdrum 
way.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, Lettice, you must have been quite an education to 
them!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I hope they were an education to me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I hope your conscience is not going to be such a rampant and 
obstructive thing as that which they possess in common,&rsquo; said 
Bertha.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I wish it had been,&rsquo; said Mrs. Bury gravely.</p>
<p>&lsquo;At any rate, the deadly lively time has brisked you all 
up,&rsquo; said Bertha, laughing.</p>
<p>Constance, on her Saturdays and Sundays, looked on with a kind of 
wonder.&nbsp; She was not exactly of either set.&nbsp; The children were 
all so young as to look on her as a grown-up person, though willing to let 
her play with them; and she was outside the group of young married people, 
and could not enter into their family fun; but this kind of playfulness and
merriment was quite a revelation to her.&nbsp; She had never before seen 
mirth, except, of course, childish and schoolgirl play, that had not in it 
something that hurt her taste and jarred on her feeling as much as did 
Ida&rsquo;s screeching laughter in comparison with the soft ripplings of 
these young matrons.</p>
<p>Still, little Michael was her chief delight, and <!-- page 168--><a 
name="page168"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 168</span>she could hardly be 
detached from him.&nbsp; She refreshed her colloquial German (or rather 
Austrian) with his nurse, who had much to say of the goodness of <i>die 
Gnadigen Frauen</i>.&nbsp; Poor thing, she was the youthful widow of a 
guide, and the efforts of the two Frauen had been in vain to keep alive her
only child, after whose death she had found some consolation in taking 
charge of Lady Northmoor&rsquo;s baby on the way home.&nbsp; Constance 
hoped Ida might never hear this fact.</p>
<p>Some degree of prosperity was greeting the little heir.&nbsp; A bit of 
moorland, hitherto regarded as worthless, had first been crossed by a 
branch line, and the primary growth of a station had been followed by the 
discovery of good building stone, and the erection of a crop of houses of 
all degrees, which promised to set the Northmoor finances on a better 
footing than had been theirs for years, and set their conscientious 
landlord to work at once on providing church room and schools.</p>
<p>All this, and that most precious possession at home, combined to give 
Lord Northmoor an amount of spirit and life that enabled him to take his 
place in the county, emancipate himself from the squire, show an opinion of
his own, and open his mouth occasionally.&nbsp; As Bertha observed, no one 
would ever have called him a stick if he had begun like this.&nbsp; To 
people like these, humbled and depressed in early life, a little happiness 
was a great stimulus.</p>
<h2><!-- page 169--><a name="page169"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
169</span>CHAPTER XXV<br />
THE LOVE</h2>
<p>It was not till Christmas that Ida had the opportunity of making her 
observations.&nbsp; By that time &lsquo;Mite,&rsquo; as he was supposed to 
have named himself, had found the use of his feet, and was acquiring that 
of his tongue.&nbsp; In fact, he was a very fine forward child, who might 
easily have been supposed to be eighteen months old instead of fifteen, as 
Ida did not fail to remark.</p>
<p>He was a handsome little creature, round and fair, with splendid sturdy 
legs and mottled arms, hair that stood up in a pale golden crest, round 
blue eyes and a bright colour, without much likeness as yet to either 
parent, though Lord Northmoor declared that there was an exact resemblance 
to his own brother, Charles, Herbert&rsquo;s father, as he first remembered
him.&nbsp; Ida longed to purse up her lips but did not dare, and was 
provoked to see her mother taken completely captive by his charms, and 
petting him to the utmost extent.</p>
<p>Indeed, Lady Northmoor, who was very much afraid of spoiling him, was 
often distressed when <!-- page 170--><a name="page170"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 170</span>such scenes as this took place.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;Mite! Mite, dear, no!&rsquo; when his fat little hands had grasped 
an ivory paper-cutter, and its blade was on the way to the button 
mouth.&nbsp; &lsquo;No!&rsquo; as he paused and looked at her.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;Here&rsquo;s Mite&rsquo;s ball! poor little dear, do let him have 
it&rsquo;&mdash;and Mite, reading sympathy in his aunt&rsquo;s face, 
laughed in a fascinating triumphant manner, and took a bite with his small 
teeth.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mite! mother said no!&rsquo; and it was gently taken from his 
hand, but before the fingers had embraced the substituted ball, a 
depreciating look and word of remonstrance gave a sense of ill-usage and 
there was a roar.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, poor little dear!&nbsp; Here&mdash;auntie&rsquo;s goody 
goody&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, no, please, Emma, he has had quite as many as he ought!&nbsp;
No, no, Mite&mdash;&rsquo; and he was borne off sobbing in her arms, while 
Ida observed, &lsquo;There! is that the way people treat their own 
children?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Some people never get rid of the governess,&rsquo; observed Mrs. 
Morton, quite unconscious that but for her interference there would have 
been no contest and no tears.</p>
<p>But she herself had no doubts, and was mollified by Mary&rsquo;s plea on
her return.&nbsp; &lsquo;He is quite good now, but you see, there is so 
much danger of our spoiling him, we feel that we cannot begin too soon to 
make him obedient.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I could not bear to keep a poor child under in that 
way.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I believe it saves them a great deal if obedience is an 
instinct,&rsquo; said Mary.</p>
<p>It had not been Mrs. Morton&rsquo;s method, and she <!-- page 171--><a 
name="page171"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 171</span>was perfectly 
satisfied with the result, so she only made some inarticulate sound; but 
she thought Frank quite as unnatural, when he kept Michael on his knee at 
breakfast, but with only an empty spoon to play with!&nbsp; All the tossing
and playing, the radiant smiles between the two did not in her eyes atone 
for these small beginnings of discipline, even though her 
brother-in-law&rsquo;s first proceeding, whenever he came home, was to look
for his son, and if the child were not in the drawing-room, to hurry up to 
the nursery and bring him down, laughing and shouting.</p>
<p>The Tyrolean nurse had been sacrificed to those notions of training 
which the Westhaven party regarded as so harsh.&nbsp; Her home sickness and
pining for her mountains had indeed fully justified the &lsquo;rampant 
consciences,&rsquo; as to the humanity as well as the expedience of sending
her home before her indulgence of the Kleiner Freiherr had had time to 
counteract his parents&rsquo; ideas, and her place had been supplied by the
nurse whom Amice was outgrowing, so that Ida was disappointed of her 
intentions of examining her, and laid up the circumstances as suspicious, 
though, on the other hand, her mother was gratified at exercising a bit of 
patronage by recommending a nursery girl from Westhaven.&nbsp; The next 
winter, however, was not marked by a visit to Northmoor.&nbsp; Ida had been
having her full share of the summer and early autumnal gaieties of 
Westhaven, and among the yachts who were given to putting in there was a 
certain <i>Morna</i>, belonging to Sir Thomas Brady, who had become a 
baronet by force of success in speculation.&nbsp; His son, who chiefly <!--
page 172--><a name="page172"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 172</span>used 
it, showed evident admiration of Miss Morton&rsquo;s bright cheeks and 
eyes, and so often resorted to Westhaven, and dropped in at what she had 
named Northmoor cottage, that there was fair reason for supposing that this
might result in more than an ordinary flirtation.</p>
<p>However, at the regatta, when she had looked for distinguished attention
on his part, she felt herself absolutely neglected, and the very next day 
the <i>Morna</i> sailed away, without a farewell.</p>
<p>Ida at first could hardly believe it.&nbsp; When she did, the conviction
came upon her that his son&rsquo;s attachment had been reported to Sir 
Thomas, and that the young man had been summoned away against his 
will.&nbsp; It would have been different, no doubt, had Herbert still been 
heir-presumptive.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That horrid little Mite!&rsquo; said she.</p>
<p>Whether her heart or her ambition had been most affected might be 
doubtful.&nbsp; At any rate, the disappointment added to the oppression of 
a heavy cold on the chest, which she had caught at the regatta, and which 
became severe enough to call for the doctor.</p>
<p>Thus the mother and daughter did not go to Northmoor.&nbsp; At a ball 
given on board a steam yacht just before Christmas Ida caught a violent 
cold on the chest, the word congestion was uttered, and an opinion was 
pronounced that as she had always weak lungs, a spring abroad would be 
advisable.</p>
<p>Mrs. Morton wrote a letter with traces of tears upon it, appealing to 
her brother-in-law to assist her as the only hope of saving her dearest 
child, and the quarries had done so well during the last year <!-- page 
173--><a name="page173"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 173</span>that he was 
able to respond with a largesse sufficient for her needs, though not for 
her expectations.</p>
<p>Mrs. Morton would have liked to have taken Constance as interpreter, and
general aid and assistant; but Constance was hard at work, aspiring to a 
scholarship, at a ladies&rsquo; college, and it was plain that her sister 
was not so desirous of her company as to make her mother overrule her 
wishes as a duty.</p>
<p>In fact, Ida had found a fellow-traveller who would suit her much better
than Constance.&nbsp; Living for the last year in lodgings near at hand was
a Miss Gattoni, daughter of an Italian courier and French lady&rsquo;s 
maid.&nbsp; As half boarder at a third-rate English school, she had 
acquired education enough to be first a nursery-governess, and later a 
companion; and in her last situation, when she had gone abroad several 
times with a rheumatic old lady, she had recommended herself enough to 
receive a legacy which rendered her tolerably independent.&nbsp; She was 
very good-natured, and had graduated in the art of making herself 
acceptable, and, as she really wished to go abroad again, she easily 
induced Mrs. Morton and Ida to think it a great boon that she should join 
forces with them, and as she was an experienced traveller with a convenient
smattering of various tongues, she really smoothed their way considerably 
and lived much more at her ease than she could have done upon her own 
resources, always frequenting English hotels and boarding-houses.</p>
<p>Mrs. Morton and Ida were of that order of tourists who do not so much 
care for sights as for being on a level with those who have seen them; and 
besides, Ida was scarcely well or in spirits <!-- page 174--><a 
name="page174"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 174</span>enough for much 
exertion till after her first month at Nice, which restored her altogether 
to her usual self, and made her impatient of staying in one place.</p>
<p>It is not, however, worth while to record the wanderings of the trio, 
until in the next summer they reached Venice, where Ida declared her 
intention of penetrating into the Dolomites.&nbsp; There was an 
outcry.&nbsp; What could she wish for in that wild and savage country, 
where there was no comfortable hotel, no society, no roads&mdash;nothing in
short to make life tolerable, whereas an hotel full of Americans of extreme
politeness to ladies, and expeditions in gondolas, when one could talk and 
have plenty of attention, were only too delightful?</p>
<p>That peaks should be more attractive than flirtations was inexplicable, 
but at last in secret confabulation Ida disclosed her motive, and in 
another private consultation Mrs. Morton begged Miss Gattoni to agree to 
it, as the only means of satisfying the young lady, or putting her mind at 
rest about a fancy her mother could not believe in; though even as she 
said, &lsquo;it would be so very shocking, it is perfectly ridiculous to 
think my brother Lord Northmoor would be capable,&rsquo; the shrewd 
confidante detected a lingering wish that it might be so!</p>
<p>Maps and routes were consulted, and it was decided that whereas to go 
from Venice through Cadore would involve much mule-riding and rough roads, 
the best way would be to resort to the railway to Verona, and thence to 
Botzen as the nearest point whence Ratzes could be reached.</p>
<h2><!-- page 175--><a name="page175"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
175</span>CHAPTER XXVI<br />
IDA&rsquo;S WARNING</h2>
<p>Botzen proved to be very hot and full of smells, nor did Mrs. Morton 
care for its quaint old medieval houses, but Ida&rsquo;s heart had begun to
fail her when she came so near the crisis, and on looking over the 
visitors&rsquo; book she gave a cry.&nbsp; &lsquo;Ah, if we had only 
known!&nbsp; It is all of no use.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How?&rsquo; she was asked.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That horrid Mrs. Bury!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of course she is.&nbsp; Only a week ago she was here.&nbsp; If 
she is at Ratzes, of course we can do nothing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And the road is <i>affreux</i>, perfectly frightful,&rsquo; said 
Mademoiselle.&nbsp; &lsquo;I have been inquiring about it.&nbsp; No access 
except upon mules.&nbsp; A whole day&rsquo;s journey&mdash;and the 
hotel!&nbsp; Bah, it is <i>vilain</i>!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If Ida is bent on going she must go without me,&rsquo; said Mrs. 
Morton.&nbsp; &lsquo;I&mdash;I have had enough of those horrid 
beasts.&nbsp; Ida&rsquo;s nonsense will be the death of me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t see much good in going on with that <!-- page 
176--><a name="page176"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 176</span>woman 
there,&rsquo; said Ida gloomily.&nbsp; &lsquo;She would be sure to stifle 
all inquiry.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A good thing too,&rsquo; muttered poor, weary Mrs. Morton.</p>
<p>Ida turned the leaves of the visitors&rsquo; book till she found the 
names of Lord and Lady Northmoor, and then, growing more eager as 
obstructions came in her way, and not liking to turn back as if on a 
fool&rsquo;s errand, she suggested to Miss Gattoni that questions might be 
asked about their visit.&nbsp; The Tyrolean patois was far beyond her, and 
not too comprehensible to her friend, but there was a waiter who could 
speak French, and the landlady&rsquo;s German was tolerable.</p>
<p>The milord and miladi were perfectly remembered, as well as their long 
detention, but the return had been by way of Italy, so they had not 
revisited Botzen with their child the next spring.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But,&rsquo; said the hostess, &lsquo;there is a young woman in 
the next street who can tell you more than I.&nbsp; She offered herself as 
a nurse.&rsquo;</p>
<p>This person was at once sent for.&nbsp; She was the same who had been 
mentioned by Mrs. Bury, but she had exchanged the peasant costume, which 
had, perhaps, only been assumed to please the English ladies, for the 
townswoman&rsquo;s universal endeavour at French fashion, which by no means
enhanced her rather coarse beauty, which was more Italian than 
Austrian.</p>
<p>Italian was the tongue which chiefly served as a medium between her and 
Miss Gattoni, though hers was not pure enough to be easily 
understood.&nbsp; Mrs. Morton and Ida put questions which Miss Gattoni <!--
page 177--><a name="page177"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
177</span>translated as best she could, and made out as much as possible of
the answers.&nbsp; It was elicited that she had not been allowed to see the
English miladi.&nbsp; All had been settled by the signora who came yearly, 
and they had rejected her after all her trouble; the doctor had recommended
her, and though her <i>creatura</i> would have been just the right age, and
that little <i>ipocrila&rsquo;s</i> child was older, ever so much 
older&mdash;she spread out her hands to indicate infinity.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; said Ida, &lsquo;I always thought so.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ask her how much older,&rsquo; demanded Mrs. Morton.</p>
<p>The replies varied from nearly <i>un sanestre</i> to <i>tre 
settimane</i>&mdash;and no more could be made of that question.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Where was the foster-child?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Again the woman threw up her hands to indicate that she had no 
notion&mdash;what was it to her?&nbsp; She could not tell if it were alive 
or dead; but (upon a leading question) it had not been seen since 
Hedwige&rsquo;s departure nor after return.&nbsp; Was it boy or girl? and, 
after some hesitation, it was declared to have been <i>un maschio</i>.</p>
<p>There was more, which nobody quite understood, but which sounded 
abusive, and they were glad to get rid of her with a couple of 
<i>thalers</i>.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well?&rsquo; said Ida triumphantly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well?&rsquo; echoed her mother in a different tone.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you were all saying, but I&rsquo;m sure of 
this, that that woman was only looking to see what you wanted her to 
say.&nbsp; I watched the cunning look of her eyes, and I would not give 
that for her word,&rsquo; with a gesture of her fingers.</p>
<p><!-- page 178--><a name="page178"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
178</span>&lsquo;But, ma, you didn&rsquo;t understand!&nbsp; Nothing could 
be plainer.&nbsp; The doctor recommended her, and sent her over in proper 
time, but she never saw any one but Mrs. Bury, who, no doubt, had made her 
arrangements.&nbsp; Then this other woman&rsquo;s child was 
older&mdash;nobody knows how much&mdash;but we always agreed that nobody 
could believe Mite, as they call him, was as young as they said.&nbsp; And 
then that other child was a boy, and it has vanished.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t believe she knew.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, I do not think she did,&rsquo; chimed in Miss Gattoni.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;This <i>canaille</i> will say anything!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I believe the woman,&rsquo; said Ida obstinately.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;Her evidence chimes in with all my former conclusions.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The older ladies both had a strong misgiving that the conclusions had 
formed the evidence, and Mrs. Morton, though she had listened all along to 
Ida&rsquo;s grumbling, was perfectly appalled at the notion of bringing 
such a ridiculous accusation against the brother-in-law, against whom she 
might indeed murmur, but whom she knew to be truthful and 
self-denying.&nbsp; She ventured to represent that it was impossible to go 
upon this statement without ascertaining whether the Grantzen child was 
alive, or really dead and buried at Ratzes, and that the hostess of the inn
would have been better evidence, but&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He that of purpose looks beside the mark,<br />
Might as well hoodwinked shoot as in the dark,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and Ida was certain that all the people at Ratzes had been bribed, and 
that no one would dare to speak out while Mrs. Bury kept guard there.&nbsp;
<!-- page 179--><a name="page179"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
179</span>Indeed, for that lady to guess at such suspicions and inquiries 
would have been so dreadful that Ratzes was out of the question, much to 
the relief of the elders, dragged along by the masterful maiden against 
their better judgment, though indeed Miss Gattoni gave as much sympathy in 
her <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;tes</i> with Ida as she did to her 
mother in their consultations.</p>
<p>They were made to interview the doctor, but he knew as little about the 
matter as the disappointed <i>balia</i>, and professed to know much 
less.&nbsp; In point of fact, though he had been called in after the 
accident, Mrs. Bury had not thought much of his skill, and had not promoted
after-visits.&nbsp; There had not been time to summon him when the birth 
took place, and Mrs. Bury thought her experience more useful afterwards 
than his treatment was likely to be.&nbsp; So he was a slighted and 
offended man, whose testimony, given in good German, only declared the 
secretiveness, self-sufficiency, and hard-neckedness of Englander!</p>
<p>And Ida&rsquo;s state of mind much resembled that of the public when 
resolved to believe in the warming-pan.</p>

THE YOUNG PRETENDER</h2>
<p>The denunciation of the Young Pretender was not an easy matter even in 
Ida&rsquo;s eyes.&nbsp; It was one thing to have a pet grievance and see 
herself as a heroine, righting her dear injured brother&rsquo;s wrongs, and
another to reproach two of the quietest most matter-of-fact people in the 
world with the atrocious frauds of which only a wicked baronet was 
capable.</p>
<p>She was not sorry that the return to England was deferred by the tenants
of the house at Westhaven wanting to stay on; and when at length a 
Christmas visit was paid at Northmoor, Mite was an animated little 
personage of three and a quarter, and, except that he could not accomplish 
a <i>k</i>, perfect in speaking plainly and indeed with that pretty 
precision of utterance that children sometimes acquire when baby language 
has not been foolishly fastened.&nbsp; Indeed, his pet name of Mite was 
only for strictly private use.&nbsp; Except to his nearest relatives, he 
was always Michael.</p>
<p>Mrs. Morton was delighted with him, and would have liked to make up for 
her knowledge of Ida&rsquo;s <!-- page 181--><a name="page181"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 181</span>suspicions by extra petting, and by 
discovering resemblances to all the family portraits as well as to his 
parents, none of which any one else could see.&nbsp; She lived upon thorns 
lest Ida should burst out with some accusation, but Ida had not the 
requisite impudence, and indeed, in sight of the boy with his parents, her 
&lsquo;evidence&rsquo; faded into such stuff as dreams are made of.</p>
<p>There was some vexation, indeed, that Louisa the nursery-maid, whom Mrs.
Morton had recommended, had had to be dismissed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am sorry,&rsquo; said Mrs. Morton, &lsquo;for, as I told you, 
her father was the mate aboard the <i>Emma Jane</i>, my poor father&rsquo;s
ship, you know, and went down with poor pa and my poor dear Charlie.&nbsp; 
And her mother used to char for us, which was but her due.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, I know,&rsquo; said Mary; &lsquo;Frank and I were both very 
sorry, and we would have found her another place, but she would go 
home.&nbsp; You see, we could not keep her in the nursery, for we must have
a thoroughly trustworthy person to go out with Michael.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What!&nbsp; Can&rsquo;t your fine nurse?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Eden?&nbsp; It is her one imperfection.&nbsp; It is some weakness
of the spine, and neither she nor I can be about with Michael as long as it
is good for him.&nbsp; I thought he must be safe in the garden, but it 
turned out that Louisa had been taking him down to the village, and there 
meeting a sailor, who I believe came up in a collier to Colbeam.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, an old friend from Westhaven?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sam Rattler,&rsquo; suggested Ida.&nbsp; &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you 
<!-- page 182--><a name="page182"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
182</span>remember, mamma, Mrs. Hall said they were sweethearting, and she 
wanted to get her out of the way of him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Perhaps,&rsquo; said Lady Northmoor, &lsquo;but I should have 
forgiven it if she had told me the truth and not tempted Mite.&nbsp; She 
used to make excuses to Eden for going down to the village, and at last she
took Mite there, and they gave him sweets at the shop not to 
tell!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did he?&rsquo; said Ida, rather hoping the model boy would have 
failed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh yes.&nbsp; The dear little fellow did not understand keeping 
things back, and when his papa was giving him his nightly sugar-plum, he 
said, &ldquo;Blue man gave me a great striped sweet, and it stuck in my 
little teeth&rdquo;; and then, when we asked when and where, he said, 
&ldquo;Down by Betty&rsquo;s, when I was out with Cea and Louie&rdquo;; and
so it came out that she had taken him into the village, met this man, 
brought him into the grounds by the little gate, and tried to bribe Mite to
say nothing about it.&nbsp; Cea told us all about it,&mdash;the little girl
who lives with Miss Morton.&nbsp; Of course we could never let him go out 
with her again, and you would hardly believe what an amount of falsehoods 
she managed to tell Eden and me about it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, if you had lived at Westhaven you would have found out that 
to be so particular is the way to make those girls fib,&rsquo; said Mrs. 
Morton.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I hope not.&nbsp; I think we have a very good girl now, trained 
up in an orphanage.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, those orphanage girls are the worst of all.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve 
had enough of them.&nbsp; They break everything <!-- page 183--><a 
name="page183"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 183</span>to pieces, and they 
run after the lads worst of all, because they have never seen one 
before!&rsquo;</p>
<p>To which Mary answered by a quiet &lsquo;I hope it may not turn out 
so.&rsquo;</p>
<p>There were more agitating questions to be brought forward.&nbsp; Herbert
had behaved very fairly well ever since the escapade of the pied rook; the 
lad kept his promise as to betting faithfully in his uncle&rsquo;s absence,
and though it had not been renewed, he had learnt enough good sense to keep
out of mischief.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, however, he had not the faculty of passing 
examinations.&nbsp; He was not exactly stupid or idle, but any kind of 
study was a bore to him, and the knowledge he was forced to &lsquo;get 
up&rsquo; was not an acquisition that gave him the slightest satisfaction 
for its own sake, or that he desired to increase beyond what would carry 
him through.&nbsp; Naturally, he had more cleverness than his uncle, and 
learning was less difficult to him, but he only used his ability to be 
sooner done with a distasteful task, which never occupied his mind for a 
moment after it was thrown aside.&nbsp; Thus time after time he had failed 
in passing for the army, and now only one chance remained before being 
reduced to attempting to enter the militia.&nbsp; And suppose that there he
failed?</p>
<p>He remained in an amiable, passive, good-humoured state, rather amused 
than otherwise at his mother&rsquo;s impression that it was somehow all his
uncle&rsquo;s fault, and ready to be disposed of exactly as they pleased 
provided that he had not the trouble of thinking about it or of working 
extra hard.</p>
<p><!-- page 184--><a name="page184"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
184</span>Mrs. Morton was sure that something could be done.&nbsp; Could 
not his uncle send him to Oxford?&nbsp; Then he could be a clergyman, or a 
lawyer or anything.&nbsp; Oh dear, were there those horrid examinations 
there too?&nbsp; And then those gentlemen that belonged to the ambassadors 
and envoys&mdash;she was sure Mr. Rollstone had told her any one who had 
connection could get that sort of appointment to what they called the Civil
Service.&nbsp; What, examinations again? connection no good?&nbsp; Well, it
was shame!&nbsp; What would things come to?&nbsp; As Mr Rollstone said, it 
was mere ruin!</p>
<p>Merchant&rsquo;s office?&nbsp; Bah! such a gentleman as her Herbert was,
so connected!&nbsp; What was his uncle thinking of, taking him up to put 
him down in that way?&nbsp; It was hard.</p>
<p>And Lord Northmoor was thankful to the tears that as usual choked her, 
while he begged her at present to trust to that last chance.&nbsp; It would
be time to think what was to come next if that failed.</p>
<p>Wherewith the victim passed the window whistling merrily, apparently 
perfectly regardless of his doom, be it what it might, and with Mite 
clinging to his hand in ecstatic admiration.</p>
<p>Constance too was in question.&nbsp; Here she was at eighteen, a 
ladylike, pleasant, good girl, very nice-looking, sweet-faced, and 
thoughtful, having finished her course at the High School with great 
credit, but alas! it was not in the family to win scholarships.&nbsp; She 
did things well, but not so brilliantly as cleverer girls, having something
of her uncle&rsquo;s tardiness of power.</p>
<p>Her determination to be a governess was as <!-- page 185--><a 
name="page185"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 185</span>decided as ever, and 
it was first brought before her mother by an offer on Lady Adela&rsquo;s 
part to begin with her at once for Amice, who was now eleven years old.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Really, now!&rsquo; said Mrs. Morton, stopping short to express 
her offence.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That is&mdash;&rsquo; added Ida, equally at a loss.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But what do you mean, mamma?&rsquo; said Constance.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;I always intended to be a teacher; I think it noble, useful 
work.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, my poor child! what have they brought you to?&nbsp; 
Pretending such affection, too!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Indeed, mamma, I have meant this always.&nbsp; I could not be 
dependent all my life, you know.&nbsp; Do listen, mamma; don&rsquo;t 
Ida&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That my Lady Adela should insult us that way, when you are as 
good as she!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nonsense, Ida!&nbsp; That has nothing to do with it.&nbsp; It is 
the greatest possible compliment, and I am very much pleased.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Just to live there, at her beck and call, drudging at that 
child&rsquo;s lessons!&rsquo; sneered Ida.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, and when I made sure, at least after all the fuss they have 
made with you, that your aunt would present you at Court, and make you the 
young lady of the house, and marry you well, but there&rsquo;s no trust to 
be placed in them&mdash;none!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, mamma, don&rsquo;t cry.&nbsp; I should not feel it right, 
unless Aunt Mary really needed me, and, though she is so kind and dear, she
does not really.&nbsp; My only doubt is&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You have a doubt, then?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes.&nbsp; I should be so much fitter if I could go <!-- page 
186--><a name="page186"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 186</span>to one of 
the ladies&rsquo; colleges, and then come back to dear little Amice, but 
now I have failed, I don&rsquo;t like to let Uncle Frank spend all that 
money on me, when I might be earning eighty pounds for myself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, you are a strange girl, with no proper pride for your 
family,&rsquo; said her mother.</p>
<p>And Ida chimed in: &lsquo;Yes.&nbsp; Do you think any one will be likely
to marry you? or if you don&rsquo;t care about yourself, you might at least
think of me!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Morton shed her ready tears when talking it over with Lady 
Northmoor.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You see,&rsquo; said Mary gently, &lsquo;I should like nothing 
better than to have dear little Conny to live with me like a daughter, but,
for one thing, it would not be fair towards Ida, and besides, it would not 
be good for her in case she did not marry to have wasted these 
years.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Morton by no means appreciated the argument.&nbsp; However, Lord 
Northmoor put off the matter by deciding to send Constance to St. 
Hugh&rsquo;s Hall, thinking she really deserved such a reward to her 
diligence.</p>
<h2><!-- page 187--><a name="page187"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
187</span>CHAPTER XXVIII<br />
TWO BUNDLES OF HAY</h2>
<p>Ida was, as all agreed, much improved in looks, style, and manners by 
her travels.&nbsp; Her illness had begun the work of fining her down from 
the bouncing heartiness of her girlhood, and she really was a handsome 
creature, with dark glowing colouring; her figure had improved, whether 
because or in spite of her efforts in that way might be doubtful; and she 
had learnt how to dress herself in fairly good taste.</p>
<p>Though neither Mademoiselle Gattoni nor the boarding-house society she 
had frequented was even second-rate in style, still there was an advance 
over her former Westhaven circle, with a good deal more restraint, so that 
she had almost insensibly acquired a much more ladylike air and 
deportment.</p>
<p>Moreover, the two years&rsquo; absence had made some changes.&nbsp; The 
young men who had been in the habit of exchanging noisy jests with Ida had 
mostly drifted away in different directions or sobered down; girl 
companions had married off; and a new terrace had been completed with <!-- 
page 188--><a name="page188"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
188</span>inhabitants and sojourners of a somewhat higher grade, who 
accepted Mrs. and Miss Morton as well connected.</p>
<p>Mr. Rollstone&rsquo;s lodgings were let to Mr. Deyncourt, a young 
clergyman who had come full of zeal to work up the growing district.&nbsp; 
He had been for a short time in the Northmoor neighbourhood, and had taken 
the duty there for a few weeks, so that he heard the name of Morton as 
prominent in good works, and had often seen Lady Adela and Constance with 
the Sunday-school.&nbsp; As Mr. Rollstone was not slow to mention the 
connection, he was not slow to call on Mrs. Morton and Miss Morton, in 
hopes of their co-operation, and as Mr. Rollstone had informed them that he
was of &lsquo;high family&rsquo; and of good private means, Mrs. Morton had
a much better welcome for him than for his poor little predecessor, who 
lived over a shoemaker&rsquo;s shop, and, as she averred, never came except
to ask subscriptions for some nonsense or other.</p>
<p>Mr. Deyncourt was a tall fine-looking man, and did not begin by asking 
subscriptions, but talked about Northmoor, Constance, and Lady Adela, so 
that Ida found herself affecting much closer knowledge of both than she 
really had.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I found,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;that your sister is most valuable
in the Sunday-school.&nbsp; I wonder if you would kindly assist 
us.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Morton began, &lsquo;My daughter is not strong, Mr. 
Deyncourt.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And Ida simpered and said, hesitating, &lsquo;I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t 
know.&rsquo;</p>
<p>If poor Mr. Brown had ever been demented <!-- page 189--><a 
name="page189"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 189</span>enough even to make 
the same request, he would have met with a very different answer.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I do not think it will be very fatiguing,&rsquo; said Mr. 
Deyncourt.&nbsp; &lsquo;Do you know Mrs. Brandon?&nbsp; No!&nbsp; I will 
ask her to call and explain our plans.&nbsp; She is kind enough to let me 
meet the other teachers in her dining-room once a week to arrange the 
lessons for the Sunday.&nbsp; There are Miss Selwood and Mrs. and Miss 
Hume.&rsquo;</p>
<p>These were all in the social position in which Ida was trying to 
establish her footing, and though she only agreed to &lsquo;think about 
it,&rsquo; her mind was pretty well made up that it would be a very 
different thing from the old parish school where Rose Rollstone used to 
work among a set of small tradesmen&rsquo;s daughters.</p>
<p>When she found herself quite the youngest and best-looking of the party,
she was entirely won over.&nbsp; There was no necessity for speaking so as 
to betray one&rsquo;s ignorance during Mr. Deyncourt&rsquo;s instructions, 
and she was a person of sufficient force and spirit to impose good order on
her class; and thus she actually obtained the gratitude of the young 
clergyman as an efficient assistant.</p>
<p>Their domiciles being so near together, there were many encounters in 
going in and out, nor were these avoided on either side.&nbsp; Ida had a 
wonderful amount of questions to ask, and used to lie in wait to get them 
solved.&nbsp; It was very interesting to lay them before a handsome young 
clergyman with a gentle voice, sweet smile, and ready attention, and 
religion seemed to have laid aside that element of dulness and moping which
had previously repelled her.</p>
<p><!-- page 190--><a name="page190"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
190</span>She was embroidering a stole for Easter, and wanted a great deal 
of counsel for it; and she undertook to get a basket of flowers for Easter 
decorations from Northmoor, where her request caused some surprise and much
satisfaction in the simple pair, who never thought of connecting the 
handsome young mission priest with this sudden interest in the Church.</p>
<p>And Mr. Deyncourt had no objection to drop in for afternoon tea when he 
was met on the sands and had to be consulted about the stole, or to be 
asked who was worthy of broth, or as time went on to choose soup and 
practise a duet for the mission concert that was to keep people out of 
mischief on the Bank-holiday.</p>
<p>Ida had a voice, and music was the one talent she had cared to 
cultivate; she had had good lessons during her second winter abroad, and 
was an acquisition to the amateur company.&nbsp; Besides, what she cared 
for more, it was a real pleasure and rest to the curate to come in and 
listen to her or sing with her.&nbsp; She had learnt what kind of things 
offended good taste, and she set herself to avoid them and to school her 
mother into doing the same.</p>
<p>What Mr. Deyncourt thought or felt was not known, though thus much was 
certain, that he showed himself attentive enough to this promising young 
convert, and made Mrs. Brandon and other prudent, high-bred matrons 
somewhat uneasy.</p>
<p>And in the midst the <i>Morna</i> put in at Westhaven, and while Ida was
walking home from Mrs. Brandon&rsquo;s, she encountered Mr. Brady, looking 
extremely well turned-out in yachting costume and smoking a short pipe.</p>
<p><!-- page 191--><a name="page191"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
191</span>There was something very flattering in the sound of the 
exclamation with which he greeted her; and then, as they shook hands, 
&lsquo;I should not have known you, Miss Morton; you are&mdash;&rsquo; and 
he hesitated for a compliment&mdash;&lsquo;such a stunner!&nbsp; What have 
you been doing to yourself?&rsquo;</p>
<p>At the gate of the narrow garden, Mr. Deyncourt overtook them, carrying 
Ida&rsquo;s bag of books for her.&nbsp; She introduced them, and was 
convinced that they glared at each other.</p>
<p>And there ensued a time of some perplexity, but much enjoyment, on 
Ida&rsquo;s part.&nbsp; Mr. Brady reviled the parson and all connected 
therewith in not very choice language, and the parson, on his side, though 
saying nothing, seemed to her to be on the watch, and gratified, if not 
relieved, when she remained steady to her parochial work.</p>
<p>And what was her mind?&nbsp; Personally, she had come to like and 
approve Mr. Deyncourt the most, and to have a sense that there was 
satisfaction in that to which he could lead her, while the better taste 
that had grown in her was sometimes offended, almost insulted, by Tom 
Brady&rsquo;s tendency to coarseness, and to treating her not as a lady, 
but as the Westhaven belle he had honoured with his attentions two years 
before.&nbsp; Yet she had an old kindness for him as her first love.&nbsp; 
And, moreover, he could give her eventually a title and very considerable 
wealth, a house in London, and all imaginable gaiety.&nbsp; While, as to 
Mr. Deyncourt, he was not poor and had expectations, but the utmost she 
could look to for him with confidence was Northmoor Vicarage after Mr. 
Woodman&rsquo;s time, and anywhere <!-- page 192--><a 
name="page192"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 192</span>the dull, sober, 
hard-working life of a clergyman&rsquo;s wife!</p>
<p>Which should she choose&mdash;that is, if she had her choice, or if 
either were in earnest?&nbsp; She was not sure of the curate, and therefore
perhaps longed most that he should come to the point, feeling that this 
would anyway increase her self-esteem, and if she hesitated to bind herself
to a life too high, and perhaps too dull, there was the dread, on the other
hand, that his family, who, she understood, were very grand people, would 
object to a girl with nothing of her own and a governess sister.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the Bradys were so rich that they had little need to 
care for fortune&mdash;only, the richer people were, the greater their 
expectations&mdash;and she was more at ease with Tom than with Mr. 
Deyncourt.&nbsp; They would probably condone the want of fortune if she 
could write &lsquo;Honourable&rsquo; before her name, or had any prospect 
of so doing, and the governess-ship might be a far greater drawback in 
their eyes than in those of the Deyncourts.&nbsp; &lsquo;However, thank 
goodness,&rsquo; said she to herself, &lsquo;that won&rsquo;t begin for two
or three years, and one or other will be hailed long before 
that&mdash;if&mdash;&nbsp; Oh, it is very hard to be kept out of everything
by an old stick like Uncle Frank and a little wretch like Mite, who, after 
all, is a miserable Tyrolese, and not a Morton at all!&nbsp; It really is 
too bad!&rsquo;</p>
<h2><!-- page 193--><a name="page193"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

JONES OR RATTLER</h2>
<p>When Lord Northmoor had occasion to be in London he usually went alone, 
for to take the whole party was too expensive, and not good for little 
Michael.&nbsp; Besides, Bertha Morton had so urgently begged him to regard 
her house as always ready for him, that the habit had been established of 
taking up his quarters there.</p>
<p>Some important measures were coming on after Easter, and he had some 
other business, so that, in the form of words of which she longed to cure 
him, he told her that he was about to trespass on her hospitality for a 
week or fortnight.</p>
<p>&lsquo;As long as ever you please,&rsquo; she said.&nbsp; &lsquo;I am 
glad to have some one to sit opposite to me and tell me home news,&rsquo; 
and they met at the station, she having been on an expedition on her own 
account, so that they drove home together.</p>
<p>No sooner were they within the house door than the parlour-maid began, 
&lsquo;That man has been here again, ma&rsquo;am.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What, Jones?&rsquo; said Bertha, in evident annoyance.</p>
<p><!-- page 194--><a name="page194"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
194</span>&lsquo;Yes, ma&rsquo;am, and I am sorry to say he saw little 
Cea.&nbsp; The child had run down after me when I answered the door, and he
asked her if she did not know her own father, and if she would come with 
him.&nbsp; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Miss 
Morton&rsquo;s,&rdquo; and he broke out with his ugly laugh, and says he, 
&ldquo;You be, be you, you unnatural little vagabond?&rdquo;&mdash;those 
were his very words, ma&rsquo;am&mdash;&ldquo;but a father is a father, and
if he gives up his rights he must know the reason why.&rdquo;&nbsp; He 
wanted me, the good-for-nothing, to give him half a sovereign at once, or 
he would take off the child on the spot, but, by good luck, she had been 
frightened and run away, the dear, and I had got the door between me and 
him, so I told him to be off till you came home, or I would call for the 
police.&nbsp; So he was off for that time.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Quite right, Alice,&rsquo; said Miss Morton, and then, leading 
the way upstairs and throwing herself down on a chair, she exclaimed, 
&lsquo;There, it ought to be a triumph to you, Northmoor!&nbsp; You told me
that I should have trouble about poor little Cea&rsquo;s father, the 
brute!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is he levying blackmail on you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes.&nbsp; It is horribly weak of me, I know, and I can scarcely 
believe it of myself, but one can&rsquo;t abandon a child to a wretch like 
that, and he has the law on his side.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Are you quite sure of that?&nbsp; He deserted her, I think you 
said.&nbsp; If you could establish that, or prove a conviction against 
him&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, I know she might be sent to an industrial school if I took it
before a magistrate, but if the <!-- page 195--><a name="page195"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 195</span>other alternative would be destruction, that 
would be misery to her.&nbsp; See&mdash;&rsquo; and there was a little tap 
at the door.&nbsp; &lsquo;Come in, Cea.&nbsp; There, make your curtsey to 
his lordship.&rsquo;</p>
<p>A pretty little fair-haired pale-cheeked girl, daintily but simply 
dressed, came in and made her curtsey very prettily, and replied nicely to 
Lord Northmoor&rsquo;s good-natured greeting and information that Michael 
had sent her a basket of primroses and a cowslip ball, which she would find
in the hall.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What do you say, Cea?&rsquo; said Bertha, anxious to demonstrate 
her manners.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank you, my lord, and Master Michael,&rsquo; she uttered, but 
she was evidently preoccupied with what she had to tell Miss Morton.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;Oh&rsquo;m, there was such a nasty man here!&nbsp; And he wanted me,
and said he was my father, but he wasn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; He was the same man 
that gave Master Mite and me the bull&rsquo;s-eyes when we were naughty and
Louisa went away.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Are you sure, Cea?&rsquo; both exclaimed, but to the child of six
the very eagerness of the question brought a certain confusion, and though 
more gently Lord Northmoor asked her to describe him, she could not do it, 
and indeed she had been only five when the encounter had taken place.&nbsp;
The urgency of the inquiry somehow seemed to dispose her to cry, as if she 
thought she had been naughty, and she had to be dismissed to the cowslip 
ball.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If the child is right, that man cannot be her father at 
all,&rsquo; said Lord Northmoor.&nbsp; &lsquo;That man&rsquo;s name is 
Rattler, and he is well known at Westhaven.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Should you know him?&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 196--><a name="page196"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
196</span>&lsquo;I never saw him, but I could soon find those who have done
so.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If we could only prove it!&nbsp; Oh, what a relief it would 
be!&nbsp; I dare not even send the child to school&mdash;as I meant to do, 
Northmoor, for indeed we don&rsquo;t spoil her&mdash;for fear she should be
kidnapped; and I don&rsquo;t know if the school-board officer won&rsquo;t 
be after her, and I can&rsquo;t give as a reason &ldquo;for fear she should
be stolen by her father.&rdquo;&lsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not exactly.&nbsp; It ought to be settled once for all.&nbsp; 
Perhaps the child will tell more when you have her alone.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is not Rattler only too like a nickname, or is he a native of 
Westhaven?&rsquo;</p>
<p>This Lord Northmoor thought he could find out, but the dinner was hardly
over before a message came that the man Jones had called again.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Perhaps I had better see him alone,&rsquo; said the guest, and 
Bertha was only too glad to accept the offer, so he proceeded to the little
room opening into the hall, where interviews with tradesfolk or petitioners
were held.</p>
<p>The man had a blue jersey, a cap, and an evidently sailor air, or rather
that of the coasting, lower stamp of seaman; but he was tall, rather 
handsome, and younger-looking than would have been expected of Cea&rsquo;s 
father.&nbsp; He looked somewhat taken aback by the appearance of a 
gentleman, but he stood his ground.</p>
<p>&lsquo;So I understand that you have been making demands upon Miss 
Morton,&rsquo; Lord Northmoor began.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, sir, my lord, a father has his feelings.&nbsp; <!-- page 
197--><a name="page197"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 197</span>There is a 
situation offered me in Canada, and I intend to take the little girl with 
me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, indeed!&rsquo;&nbsp; And there was a pause.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Or if the lady has taken a fancy to her, I&rsquo;d not baulk her 
for a sum down of twenty or five-and-twenty, once for all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, indeed!&rsquo; again; then &lsquo;What do you say is the 
child&rsquo;s name?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Jones, my lord.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Her Christian name, I mean?&rsquo;</p>
<p>He scratched his head.&nbsp; &lsquo;Cissy, my 
lord&mdash;Celia&mdash;Cecilia.&nbsp; Blest if I&rsquo;m sure!&rsquo; as he
watched the expression of the questioner.&nbsp; &lsquo;You see, the women 
has such fine names, and she was always called Baby when her poor mother 
was alive.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Where was she baptized?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, you see, my lord, the women-folk does all that, and I was 
at sea; and by and by I comes home to find my poor wife dead, and the 
little one gone.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I suppose you are aware that you can have no legal claim to the 
child without full proof of her belonging to you&mdash;the certificate of 
your marriage and a copy of the register of her birth?&rsquo;</p>
<p>The man was scarcely withheld from imprecations upon the work that was 
made about it, when Miss Morton had been quite satisfied on a poor 
fellow&rsquo;s word.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, ladies may be satisfied for a time, but legally more than 
your word is required, and you will remember that unless you can bring full
proof that this is your child, there is such a thing as prosecution for 
obtaining money on false pretences.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 198--><a name="page198"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
198</span>&lsquo;And how is a poor fellow to get the fees for them register
clerks and that?&rsquo; said the man, in a tone waxing insolent.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will be answerable for the fees, if you will tell me where the 
certificates are to be applied for.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, how is a cove to know what the women did when he was at 
sea?&nbsp; She died at Rotherhithe, anyway, so the child will be registered
there.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And the marriage?&nbsp; You were not at sea then, I 
suppose?&rsquo;</p>
<p>But the man averred that there were so many churches that there was no 
telling one from another, and with a knowing look declared that the gals 
were so keen after a man that they put up the banns and hauled him where 
they would.</p>
<p>He was at last got rid of, undertaking to bring the proofs of his 
paternity, without which Lord Northmoor made it clear to him that he was to
expect neither child nor money.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I greatly doubt whether you will see any more of him,&rsquo; said
Lord Northmoor when describing the interview.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, Frank,&rsquo; cried Bertha, calling him thus for the first 
time, &lsquo;I do not know how to thank you enough.&nbsp; You have done me 
an infinite kindness.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do not thank me yet,&rsquo; he answered, &lsquo;for though I do 
not in the least believe that this fellow is the child&rsquo;s father, he 
may find his way to the certificates or get them forged; and it would be 
well to trace what has become of the real Jones, as well as to make out 
about this Rattler.&nbsp; Is it true that the wife died at 
Rotherhithe?&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 199--><a name="page199"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
199</span>&lsquo;Quite true, poor thing.&nbsp; I believe they had lived 
there since the marriage.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will run down there if you can give me the address, and see if 
I can make out anything about her husband, and see whether any one can 
speak to his identity with this man.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are a man of gold!&nbsp; To think of your taking all this 
trouble!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I only hope I may succeed.&nbsp; It is a return to old habits of 
hunting up evidence.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Bertha was able to give the address of the lodging-house where poor Mrs.
Jones had died, and the next morning produced another document, which had 
been shut up in the Bible that had been rescued for the child, namely the 
marriage lines of David Jones and Lucy Smith at the parish church of the 
last Lord Northmoor&rsquo;s residence in town.</p>
<p>To expect a clergyman or clerk to remember the appearance of a 
bridegroom eight years ago was too much, even if they were the same who had
officiated; but Bertha undertook to try, and likewise to consult a former 
fellow-servant of poor Lucy, who was supposed to have abetted her 
unfortunate courtship.&nbsp; Frank, after despatching a letter of inquiry 
to his sister-in-law about &lsquo;Sam Rattler,&rsquo; set forth by train 
and river steamer for Rotherhithe.</p>
<p>When they met again in the evening, Bertha had only made out from the 
fellow-servant that the stoker was rather small, and had a reddish beard 
and hair, wherewith Cea&rsquo;s complexion corresponded.</p>
<p>The Rotherhithe discoveries had gone farther.&nbsp; Lord Northmoor had 
penetrated to the doleful den where the poor woman had died, and no wonder!
<!-- page 200--><a name="page200"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
200</span>for it seemed, as Bertha had warned him, a nest of fever and 
horrible smells.&nbsp; The landlady remembered her death, which had been 
made memorable by Miss Morton&rsquo;s visits; but knew not whence she had 
come, though, stimulated by half-a-crown, she mentioned a small grocery 
shop where more might be learnt.&nbsp; There the woman did recollect Mrs. 
Jones as a very decent lady, and likewise her being in better lodgings 
until deserted by her husband, the scamp, who had gone off in an Australian
steamer.</p>
<p>At these lodgings the inquiry resulted in the discovery of the name of 
the steamer; and there was still time to look up the agent and the date 
approximately enough to obtain the list of the crew, with David Jones among
them.&nbsp; It further appeared that this same David Jones had fallen 
overboard and been drowned, but as he had not entered himself as a married 
man, his wife had remained in ignorance of his fate.&nbsp; It was, however,
perfectly clear that the little girl was an orphan, and that Bertha might 
be quite undisturbed in the possession of her.</p>
<p>And thus Lord Northmoor came home a good deal fagged, and shocked by the
interior he had seen at Rotherhithe, but quite triumphant.</p>
<p>Bertha was delighted, and declared herself eternally grateful to him; 
and she could not but entertain the hope that the <i>soi-disant</i> parent 
would make another application, in which case she was quite prepared to 
give him into custody; and she proceeded to reckon up the number of times 
that he had applied to her, and the amount that he had extracted, wondering
at herself for not having asked <!-- page 201--><a name="page201"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 201</span>for proofs, but owning that she had been 
afraid of being thus compelled to give up the child to perdition.</p>
<p>The applications had all been within the last year, so that the man had 
probably learnt from Louisa Hall, the nursery-maid, that Cea was the child 
of a deserted wife.</p>
<p>A letter from Mrs. Morton gave some of the antecedents of Sam Rattler, 
as learnt from Mrs. Hall, the charwoman, whose great dread he was.&nbsp; 
His real surname was Jones, and he was probably a Samuel Jones whose name 
Lord Northmoor had noted as a boy on board David&rsquo;s ship.&nbsp; He 
belonged to a decent family in a country village, but had run away to sea, 
and was known at Westhaven by this nickname.&nbsp; He had a brother settled
in Canada, who had lately written to propose to him a berth on one of the 
Ontario steamers, and it was poor Mrs. Hall&rsquo;s dread that her daughter
should accompany him, though happily want of money prevented it.&nbsp; As 
to his appearance, as to which there had been special inquiries, he was a 
tall fine-looking man, with a black beard, and half the girls at Westhaven 
were fools enough to be after him.</p>
<p>All this tallied with what had been gathered from the child, and this 
last had probably been a bold attempt to procure the passage-money for his 
sweetheart.</p>
<p>He never did call again, having probably been convinced of the failure 
of his scheme, and scenting danger, so that every day for a fortnight 
Bertha met her cousin with a disappointed &lsquo;No Rattler!&rsquo;</p>
<h2><!-- page 202--><a name="page202"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
202</span>CHAPTER XXX<br />
SCARLET FEVER</h2>
<p>There was a meeting of one of the many charitable societies to which 
Bertha had made Lord Northmoor give his name, and she persuaded him to stay
on another day for it, though he came down in the morning with a sore 
throat and heavy eyes, and, contrary to his usual habits, lay about in an 
easy-chair, and dozed over the newspaper all the morning.</p>
<p>When he found himself unable to eat at luncheon, she allowed that he was
not fit for the meeting, but demurred when he declared that he should go 
home at once that afternoon to let Mary nurse his cold.&nbsp; The instinct 
of getting back to wife and home were too strong for Bertha to contend 
with, and he started, telegraphing to Northmoor to be met at the 
station.</p>
<p>Perhaps there were delays, as in his oppressed and dazed state he had 
mistaken the trains, for he did not arrive at home till nine o&rsquo;clock 
instead of seven, and then he looked so ill as he stumbled into the hall, 
dazzled by the lights, that Mary looked at him in much alarm.</p>
<p><!-- page 203--><a name="page203"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
203</span>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; he said hoarsely, &lsquo;I have a bad cold and
sore throat, and I thought I had better come home at once.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Indeed you had!&nbsp; If only you have not made it worse by the 
journey!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Which apparently he had done, for he could scarcely swallow the warm 
drinks brought to him, and had such a night, that when steps were heard in 
the house, he said&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mary, dear, don&rsquo;t let Mite come in.&nbsp; I am afraid it is
too late to keep you away, but if I had felt like this yesterday, I would 
have gone straight to the fever hospital.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh no, no, what should you do but come home to me?&nbsp; Was it 
that horrible place at Rotherhithe?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Perhaps.&nbsp; It is just a fortnight since, and I felt a strange
shudder and chill as I was talking.&nbsp; But it may be nothing; only keep 
Mite away till I have seen Trotman.&nbsp; My Mary, don&rsquo;t look like 
that!&nbsp; It may be nothing, and we have been very happy&mdash;thank 
God.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Poor Mary, in a choking state, hurried away to send for the doctor, and 
to despatch orders to Nurse Eden to confine Master Michael to the nursery 
and garden for the present, her sinking and foreboding heart forbidding her
to approach the child herself.</p>
<p>The verdict of the doctor confirmed these alarms, for all the symptoms 
of scarlet fever had by that time manifested themselves.&nbsp; Mary had 
gone through the disease long before, and had nursed through more than one 
outbreak at Miss Lang&rsquo;s, so her husband might take the comfort of 
knowing that there was little anxiety on her account, though the <!-- page 
204--><a name="page204"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 204</span>doctor, 
evidently expecting a severe attack, insisted on sending in a trained nurse
to assist her.</p>
<p>As the little boy had fortunately been in bed and asleep long before his
father came home, there was as yet no danger of infection for him, though 
he must be sent out of the house at once.</p>
<p>Lady Adela was not at home, and Mary would have doubted about sending 
him to the Cottage, even if she had been there; so she quickly made up her 
mind that Eden and the young nursery-maid should take him at once to 
Westhaven, to be either in the hotel or at Northmoor Cottage, according as 
his aunt should decide.</p>
<p>How little she had thought, when she heard him say his prayers, and 
exchanged kisses with him at the side of his little bed, that it was the 
last time for many a long day; and that her hungry spirit would have to 
feed itself on that last smile and kiss of the fat hand, as she looked out 
of her husband&rsquo;s window as the carriage drove away.</p>
<p>Lady Adela knew too well what it was to be desolate not to come home so 
as to be at hand, though she left her little daughter at her 
uncle&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Bertha came on the following day.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I feel as if it were all my doing,&rsquo; she said.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;I could not bear it, if it does not go well with him, after being 
the saving of poor little Cea.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There is nothing to reproach yourself with,&rsquo; said 
sober-minded Lady Adela.&nbsp; &lsquo;Neither you nor he could guess that 
he was running into infection.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Bertha; &lsquo;of course, one never thinks of 
such things with grown-up people, especially one whom one has always 
thought of as a stick, and to <!-- page 205--><a name="page205"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 205</span>whom perhaps ascribed some of its 
toughness,&rsquo; she added, smiling; &lsquo;but he did come home looking 
very white and worn-out, and complained of horrible smells.&nbsp; No, dear 
man, he was far too punctilious to use the word, he only said that he 
should like to send the Sanitary Commission down the alley.&nbsp; I ought 
to have dosed him with brandy on the spot, for of course he was too polite 
to ask for it, so I only gave him a cup of <i>tea</i>,&rsquo; said Bertha, 
with an infinite tone of scorn in the name of the beverage.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Will it be any comfort to tell you that most likely it would have
been too late even if he would have accepted it?&nbsp; Come, Bertha, how 
often are we told that we are not to think so much of consequences as of 
actions, and there was nothing blameworthy in the whole 
business.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Except that I was such a donkey as not to have begun by asking 
for the man&rsquo;s proofs, but I was so much afraid that he would pounce 
on the child that I only thought of buying him off from time to time.&nbsp;
I did not know I was so weak.&nbsp; Well, at any rate, with little Mite to 
the fore, the place will be left in good hands.&nbsp; I like Herbert on the
whole, but to have that woman reigning as Madame M&egrave;re would be 
awful.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nay, I trust we are not coming to that!&nbsp; Trotman says it is 
a thoroughly severe attack, but not abnormally malignant, as he calls 
it.&nbsp; It is a matter of nursing, he tells me, and that he has of the 
best&mdash;a matter of nursing and of prayer, and that,&rsquo; added Adela,
her eyes filling with tears, &lsquo;I am sure he has.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And yet&mdash;and yet,&rsquo; Bertha broke off.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, you are thinking how we prayed before!&nbsp; <!-- page 
206--><a name="page206"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 206</span>And yet, 
Birdie, after these six years of seeing his rule and recognising what mine 
would have been, I see it was for the best that my own little Michael was 
taken to his happy home.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;ll call it for the best now,&rsquo; said Bertha 
grimly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If it be so, it will prove itself; but I really do not see any 
special cause for extra fear.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Lady Adela and Bertha both thought themselves as far safe as any one can
be with scarlet fever, and would gladly have taken a share in the 
nursing.&nbsp; Bertha, however, had far too much of the whirlwind in her to
be desirable in a sick house, and on the principle that needless risk was 
wrong, was never admitted within the house doors, but Lady Adela insisted 
on seeing Mary every day, and was assured that she should be a welcome 
assistant in case of need; but at present there was no necessity of calling
in other help, the form of fever being lethargic with much torpidity, but 
no violence of delirium, and requiring no more watching than the wife and 
nurse could give.</p>
<p>Frank never failed to know his Mary, and to respond when she addressed 
him; but she was told never to attempt more than rousing him when it was 
needful to make him take food.&nbsp; He had long ago, with the precaution 
of his legal training, made every needful arrangement for her and for his 
son; and even on the first day, he had not seemed to trouble himself on 
these points, being too heavy and oppressed for the power of looking 
forward.&nbsp; So the days rolled on in one continual watch on Mary&rsquo;s
part, during which she seemed only to live <!-- page 207--><a 
name="page207"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 207</span>in the present, and, 
secure that her boy was safe, would not risk direct communication with him 
or with his nurse.</p>
<p>Lady Adela had undertaken to keep Constance, the person who really loved
her uncle best, daily informed, and she also wrote at intervals to Mrs. 
Morton, by special desire of Lady Northmoor, and likewise to her own old 
servant, Eden, the nurse.&nbsp; She wrote cheerfully, but Eden had other 
correspondents in the servants&rsquo; hall, who dwelt sensationally on the 
danger, as towards Whitsun week the fever began to run higher towards the 
crisis, the strength was reduced, the torpor became heavier; and anxiety 
increased as to whether there would be power of rally in a man who, though 
healthy, had never been strong.</p>
<p>The anxiety manifested by the entire neighbourhood was a notable proof 
of the estimation in which the patient was held, and was very far from 
springing only from pity or humanity.&nbsp; Half the people who came to 
Lady Adela for further information had some cause going on in which 
&lsquo;That Stick&rsquo; was one of the most efficient of props.</p>
<h2><!-- page 208--><a name="page208"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
208</span>CHAPTER XXXI<br />
MITE</h2>
<p>Little Michael Morton was in the meantime installed in his aunt&rsquo;s 
house.&nbsp; For him to be anywhere else was not to be thought of, and Mrs.
Morton was soft-hearted enough to be very fond of such a bright little boy,
so much in her own hands, and very amusing with the old-fashioned formal 
ways derived from chiefly consorting with older people.</p>
<p>Besides, the pretty little fellow was an object of great interest to all
her acquaintances, especially as it was understood at Westhaven that it was
only too possible that he might any day become Lord Northmoor; and never 
had Mrs. Morton&rsquo;s drawing-room been so much resorted to by visitors 
anxious for bulletins, or perhaps more truly for excitement.&nbsp; Mite was
a young gentleman of some dignity.&nbsp; He sat elevated on a hassock upon 
a chair to dine at luncheon-time, comporting himself most correctly; but 
his aunt was sorely chafed at Eden&rsquo;s standing behind his chair, like 
Sancho&rsquo;s physician, to regulate his diet, and placing her veto upon 
lobsters, cucumbers, pastry, and glasses of wine with lumps of sugar in 
them.</p>
<p><!-- page 209--><a name="page209"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
209</span>It amounted to a trial of strength between aunt and nurse.&nbsp; 
Michael submitted once or twice, when told that his mamma would not 
approve, but the lobster struck him with extreme amazement and admiration, 
and he could not believe but that the red, long-whiskered monster was not 
as good as he was beautiful.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He has got a glove like what Peter wears to cut the holly 
hedge,&rsquo; exclaimed the boy, to the general amusement.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;Where&rsquo;s his hand?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My Mite shall have a bit of his funny hand,&rsquo; said Mrs. 
Morton, and Ida was dealing with the claw, when Eden interposed and said 
she did not think her ladyship would wish Master Michael to have any.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Just a taste, nurse, with some of the cream,&rsquo; said Mrs. 
Morton.&nbsp; &lsquo;Here, Mitey dear.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, Master Michael, mamma would say no,&rsquo; said Eden.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Really, Eden, you might let Mrs. Morton judge in her own 
house,&rsquo; said Ida.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Master Morton is under my charge, ma&rsquo;am, and I am 
responsible for him,&rsquo; said Eden, respectfully but firmly.&nbsp; But 
Ida held out the claw, and Michael made a dart at it.</p>
<p>Eden again said &lsquo;No,&rsquo; but he looked up at her with an 
exulting roguish grin, and clasped it, whereupon she laid hold of him by 
the waist, and bore him off, kicking and roaring, amid the pitiful and 
indignant exclamations of his aunt and cousin.</p>
<p>It may be that the faithful Eden was somewhat wanting in tact, by her 
determined attention to the routine that chafed her hosts; but she had been
<!-- page 210--><a name="page210"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
210</span>forced to come away without directions, and could only hold fast 
to the discipline of her well-ordered nursery under all obstacles.</p>
<p>Master Michael was to have his cup of milk and run on the beach with the
nursery-maid long before the usual awakening of the easy-going household, 
which regarded late hours as belonging to gentility; then, after the 
general breakfast, his small lessons, over which there often was a battle, 
first, because he felt injured by not doing them with his mother, and next,
because his hostesses regarded them as a hardship, and taught him to cry 
over &lsquo;Reading without tears,&rsquo; besides detaining him as late as 
they could over the breakfast, or proposing to take him out at once, 
without waiting for that quarter of an hour&rsquo;s work.&nbsp; Or when 
out-of-doors, they would not bring him home for the siesta, on which his 
nurse insisted, though it was often only lying down in the dark; nor had 
Mrs. Morton any scruple in breaking it, if she wanted to exhibit him to her
friends, though if it were interrupted or omitted, the child&rsquo;s temper
was the worse all the afternoon.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That nurse is a thorough tyrant over the poor little darling, and
a very impertinent woman besides,&rsquo; said Mrs. Morton.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A regular little spoiled brat,&rsquo; Ida declared him.</p>
<p>While certainly the worse his father was said to be, the more his aunt 
tried to spoil and indulge him, as a relief to her pity and grief.</p>
<p>He had missed his home and parents a good deal at first, had cried at 
his lessons, and cried more at not having father to carry him to the 
nursery, nor mother to hear him say his prayers and kiss him at <!-- page 
211--><a name="page211"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 211</span>night; but 
time wore off the association, and he was full of delight at the sea, the 
ships, the little crabs, and all the other charms of the shore.</p>
<p>Above all, he was excited about the little boys.&nbsp; His own kind had 
never come in his way before, his chief playfellow being Amice, who was so 
much older as to play with him condescendingly and always give way to 
him.&nbsp; There was a large family in a neighbouring lodging containing 
what he respectfully called &lsquo;big knicker-bocker boys,&rsquo; who 
excited his intense admiration, and drew him like a magnet.</p>
<p>For once Mrs. Morton and Eden were agreed as to the propriety of the 
companionship, since Rollstone had pronounced them of &lsquo;high 
family,&rsquo; and the governess who was in charge of them was quite ready 
to be interested in the solitary little stranger, even if he had not been 
the Honourable Michael.&nbsp; So was the elder girl of the party, but, 
unluckily, Michael was just of the age to be a great nuisance to children 
who played combined and imaginative games which he could not yet 
understand.</p>
<p>When they were making elaborate approaches to a sand fortification, 
erected with great care and pains, he would dash on it with a <i>coup de 
main</i>, break it down at once with his spade, and stand proudly laughing 
and mixing up the ruins together, heedless of the howls of anger of the 
besiegers, and believing that he had done the right thing.</p>
<p>And once, when a wrathful boy of eight had shaken the troublesome urchin
as he would have done his own junior, had this last presumed to stir up his
clear pool of curiosities, most of the female portion of the family had 
taken the part of the <!-- page 212--><a name="page212"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 212</span>intruder, and cried shame on any one who could
hurt or molest a poor dear little boy away from a father who was so 
ill!</p>
<p>Thus the Lincoln family, for the sake of peace and self-defence, used 
sedulously to flee at the approach of Mite, and seek for secluded coves to 
which he was not likely to penetrate.</p>
<p>Mr. Rollstone was Eden&rsquo;s great solace.&nbsp; They discovered that 
they had once been staying in the same country-house, and had a great 
number of common acquaintances in the upper-servant world, and they 
entirely agreed in their estimate of Mrs. Morton and Ida, whom Mr. 
Rollstone pronounced to be neither fish, flesh, nor fowl, though as for 
Miss Constance, she was a lady all over, and always had been, and there 
might have been hopes for Mr. Herbert, if only he could have got into the 
army.</p>
<p>To sit with Mr. Rollstone, whom the last winter&rsquo;s rheumatics had 
left very infirm, was Eden&rsquo;s chief afternoon employment, as she could
not follow her charge&rsquo;s wanderings on the beach, but had to leave him
to the nursery-maid, Ellen.&nbsp; The old butler wanted much to show 
&lsquo;Miss Eden&rsquo; his daughter, who took advantage of Whit-Sunday and
the Bank-holiday to run down and see her parents, though at the next 
quarter she was coming home for good, extremely sorry to leave her 
advantages in London, and the friends she had made there, but feeling that 
her parents needed her so much that she must pursue her employment at 
home.</p>
<p>They were all very anxious on that Whit-Sunday, and Rose carried with 
her something of Constance&rsquo;s feeling, as with tears in her eyes she 
looked at the <!-- page 213--><a name="page213"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 213</span>little fellow at the children&rsquo;s service,
standing by his nurse, with wide open, inquiring eyes, chiefly fixed upon 
Willie Lincoln in satisfaction whenever an answer proceeded from that 
object of his unrequited attachment.&nbsp; With the young maiden&rsquo;s 
love of revelling in supposed grief, Rose already pitied the fair-faced, 
unconscious child as fatherless, and weighted with heavy 
responsibilities.</p>
<p>Another pair of eyes looked at the boy, not with pity, but indignant 
impatience.</p>
<p>Perhaps even already that little pretender was the only obstacle between
Herbert and the coronet that was his by right, between Ida herself 
and&mdash;</p>
<p>Ida had walked from the school to the church with Mr. Deyncourt, and he 
had talked so gently and pitifully of the family distress, and assumed so 
much grief on her part, that his sympathy made her heart throb; above all, 
when he told her that his two sisters were coming to stay with him, Mrs. 
Rollstone had contrived to make room for them, and they would show her, 
better than he could, some of the plans he wished to have carried out with 
the little children.</p>
<p>So he wished to introduce her to his sisters!&nbsp; What did that 
mean?&nbsp; If the Deyncourts were ever so high they could not sneer at 
Lord Northmoor&rsquo;s sisters.</p>
<p>Then she thought of many a novel, and in real life, of what she believed
respecting that lost lover of Miss Morton&rsquo;s.&nbsp; And later in the 
day Tom Brady lounged up to Northmoor Cottage, and leaning with one elbow 
on the window-sill, while the other arm held away the pipe he had just 
taken from his lips, <!-- page 214--><a name="page214"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 214</span>he asked if they would give him a cup of tea, 
the whole harbour was so full of such beastly, staring cads that there was 
no peace there.&nbsp; One ought to give such places a wide berth at 
Whitsuntide.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I wonder you did not,&rsquo; said Ida, as she hastened to 
compound the tea.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Forgot it,&rsquo; he lazily droned, &lsquo;forgot it.&nbsp; 
Attractions, you know,&rsquo; and, as she brought the cup to the window, 
with a lump of sugar in the tongs, &lsquo;when sugar fingers 
are&mdash;&rsquo; and the speech ended in a demonstration at the fingers 
that made Ida laugh, blush, and say, &lsquo;Oh, for shame, Mr. 
Brady!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You had better come in, Mr. Brady,&rsquo; called Mrs. 
Morton.&nbsp; &lsquo;You can&rsquo;t drink it comfortably there, and 
you&rsquo;ll be upsetting it.&nbsp; We are down in the dining-room to-day, 
because&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>The cause, necessary to her gentility, was lost, as Ida proceeded to let
him in at the front door, and he presently deposited himself on the sofa, 
grumbling complacently at the bore of holidays, especially bank 
holidays.&nbsp; His crew would have been ready to strike, he declared, if 
he had taken them out of harbour, or he would have asked the ladies to come
on a cruise out of the way of it all.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, thank you very much, Mr. Brady, but, really in my poor 
brother, Lord Northmoor&rsquo;s state, I don&rsquo;t know that it would be 
etiquette.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, yes.&nbsp; By the bye, how&rsquo;s the governor?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very sad, strength failing.&nbsp; I hardly expect to hear he is 
alive to-morrow,&rsquo; and Mrs. Morton&rsquo;s handkerchief was 
raised.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh ay, sad enough, you know!&nbsp; I say, will it make any 
difference to you?&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 215--><a name="page215"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
215</span>&lsquo;My poor, dear brother!&nbsp; Well, it ought, you 
know.&nbsp; Indeed it would if it had not been for that dear little 
boy.&nbsp; My poor Herbert!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It must have been an awful sell for him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Ida, &lsquo;and some people think there was 
something very odd about it all&mdash;the child being born out in the 
Dolomites, with nobody there!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t, Ida, I can&rsquo;t have you talk so,&rsquo; 
protested her mother.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Supposititious, by all that&rsquo;s lucky!&nbsp; I should 
strangle him!&rsquo; and Mr. Brady put back his head and laughed a loud and
hearty laugh, by no means elegant, but without much sound of truculent 
intentions.</p>

A SHOCK</h2>
<p>It was on the Thursday of Whitsun-week when Lady Adela and Bertha came 
down from their visit of inquiry, a little more hopeful than on the 
previous day, though they could not yet say that recovery was setting 
in.</p>
<p>But a great shock awaited them.&nbsp; The parlour-maid met them at the 
door, pale and tearful.&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh, my lady, Mrs. Eden&rsquo;s come, 
and&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>Poor Eden herself was in the hall, and nothing was to be heard but 
&lsquo;Oh, my lady!&rsquo; and another tempest of sobs.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Come in, Eden,&rsquo; scolded Bertha, in her impatience.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t keep us in this way.&nbsp; What has happened to the 
child?&nbsp; Let us have it at once!&nbsp; The worst, or you wouldn&rsquo;t
be here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>For all answer, Eden held up a little wooden spade, a sailor hat, and a 
shoe showing traces of sand and sea-water.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is so then,&rsquo; said Lady Adela.&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh, his 
mother!&nbsp; But,&rsquo; after that one wail, she thought of the poor 
woman before her, &lsquo;I am sure you are not to blame, Eden.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 217--><a name="page217"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
217</span>&lsquo;Oh, my lady, if I could but feel that!&nbsp; But that I 
should have trusted the darling out of my sight for a moment!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Presently they brought her to a state in which she could tell her 
lamentable history.</p>
<p>She had been spending the afternoon at Mr. Rollstone&rsquo;s, leaving 
Master Michael as usual in the care of the underling, Ellen, and after that
she knew no more till neither child nor maid came home at his supper-time, 
and Mrs. Morton was slowly roused to take alarm, while Eden, half 
distracted, wandered about, seeking her charge, and found Ellen, calling 
and shouting in vain for him.&nbsp; Ellen confessed that she had seen him 
running after the Lincoln children, and supposing him with them, had given 
herself up to the study of a penny dreadful in company with another young 
nursemaid.&nbsp; When they had awakened to real life, the first idea had 
been that he must be with these children; but they were gone, and Ellen, 
fancying that he might have gone home with them, asked at their lodging, 
but no, he was not there.</p>
<p>The tide was by this time covering the beach, and driving away the 
miserable maids, with the aunt, cousin and others who had been on the 
fruitless quest.&nbsp; No more could be done then, and they went home with 
desolation in their hearts.&nbsp; Miss Ida, as Eden declared, stayed out 
long after everybody else when it was clearly of no use, and came back so 
tired and upset that she went up straight to bed.&nbsp; There was still a 
hope that some one might have met the little boy and taken him home, unable
clearly to make out to whom he <!-- page 218--><a name="page218"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 218</span>belonged, more especially as the Lincolns in 
terror and compunction had confessed that they had seen him and his nurse 
from a distance, and had rushed headlong round a projecting rock into a 
cove, hoping that he had not seen them, because he was so tiresome and 
spoilt all their games.&nbsp; And when that morning the spade, hat, and 
shoe were discovered upon the shore, not far from the very rock, the poor 
children had to draw plenty of morals on the consequences of 
selfishness.&nbsp; No doubt that poor little Michael had pursued them 
barefooted and gone too near the waves!</p>
<p>There was nothing more but the forlorn hope that the waves would restore
the little body they had carried off, and Mrs. Morton was watching for that
last sad satisfaction.&nbsp; In case of that contingency, Ellen, as the 
last person known to have seen the boy, had been left at Westhaven, in 
agonies of despair, vowing that she would never speak to any one, nor look 
at a story-book again in her life.&nbsp; She had attempted the excuse that 
she thought she saw Miss Ida going in that direction, but the young lady 
had declared that she had never been on the beach at all that afternoon 
till after the alarm had been given; and had been extremely angry with 
Ellen for making false excuses and trying to shift off the blame, and the 
girl had been much terrified, and owned that she was not at all sure.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And oh, my lady,&rsquo; entreated Eden, &lsquo;don&rsquo;t send 
me up to the House!&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t make me face her ladyship!&nbsp; I 
should die of it!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We must think what is to be done about that,&rsquo; <!-- page 
219--><a name="page219"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 219</span>said Lady 
Adela.&nbsp; &lsquo;Can you tell whether any one from the House has seen 
you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Eden thought not, and after she had been consigned to her friend, Lady 
Adela&rsquo;s maid, to be rested, fed, and comforted as far as might be 
possible, the sisters-in-law held sad counsel, and agreed that it was not 
safe to keep back the terrible news from the poor mother who expected daily
tidings of her child, and might hear some report, in spite of her shut-up 
state.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Poor Adela, I pity you almost as much as her,&rsquo; said 
Bertha.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, I know now how much I have to be thankful for!&nbsp; No 
uncertainty&mdash;and my little one&rsquo;s grave.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Besides Amice.&nbsp; Let me drive you up, Addie.&nbsp; Your heart
is beating enough to knock you down.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, I believe it is.&nbsp; But not up to the front door.&nbsp; 
I will go in by the garden.&nbsp; Oh, may he be spared to her at 
least!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Very pale then Lady Adela crept in, meeting a weeping maid who was much 
relieved to see her, but was hardly restrained from noisy sobs.&nbsp; Mr. 
Trotman, she said, had come just before the garden boy had inevitably 
dashed up with the tidings, and the household had been waiting till he came
out, to secure that he should be near when Lady Northmoor was told.</p>
<p>Adela felt that this might be the safest opportunity, and sent a message
to the door to beg that her ladyship would come and speak to her for a few 
minutes in the study.</p>
<p>Mary&rsquo;s soft step was soon there, and her lips <!-- page 220--><a 
name="page220"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 220</span>were framing the 
words, &lsquo;No ground lost,&rsquo; when at sight of Adela&rsquo;s face 
the light went out of her eyes, and setting herself firmly on her feet, she
said, &lsquo;You have bad news.&nbsp; My boy!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Adela came near and would have taken her hand, saying&mdash;&lsquo;My 
poor Mary&rsquo;&mdash;but she clasped them both as if to hold herself 
together, and said, &lsquo;The fever!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, no&mdash;sadder still!&nbsp; Drowned!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, then there was not all that suffering, and without me!&nbsp; 
Thankworthy&mdash;&nbsp; Oh no, no, please&rsquo;&mdash;as Lady Adela, with
eyes brimming over, would have pressed her to her 
bosom&mdash;&lsquo;don&rsquo;t&mdash;don&rsquo;t upset me, or I could not 
attend to Frank.&nbsp; It all turns on this one day, they say, and I 
must&mdash;I must be as usual.&nbsp; There will be time enough to know all 
about it&mdash;if&rsquo;&mdash;with a long oppressed gasp&mdash;&lsquo;he 
is saved from the hearing it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I think you are right, dear,&rsquo; said Adela, &lsquo;if you 
keep him&mdash;&rsquo; but she could not go on.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, any way,&rsquo; said Mary, &lsquo;either he will be given 
back, or he will be saved this.&nbsp; Let me go back to him, 
please.&rsquo;&nbsp; Then at the door, putting her hand to her 
head&mdash;&lsquo;Who is here?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Poor Eden.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, let her and Emma know that I am sure it is not their 
fault.&nbsp; Come again to-morrow, please; I think he will be 
better.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She went away in that same gliding manner, perfectly tearless.&nbsp; 
Adela waited to see the doctor, who assured her that the patient had rather
gained than lost during the last twenty-four hours, and that if he could be
spared from any shock or <!-- page 221--><a name="page221"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 221</span>agitation he would probably recover.&nbsp; 
Lady Northmoor seemed so entirely absorbed by his critical state, that she 
was not likely to betray the sad knowledge she had put aside in the secret 
chamber of her heart, more especially as her husband was still too much 
weighed down, and too slumberous to be observant, or to speak much, and 
knowing the child to be out of the house, he did not inquire for him.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Mr. Trotman gladly approved of Lady Adela&rsquo;s 
intention of sleeping in the house in case of any sudden collapse; and the 
servants, who were not to let Lady Northmoor know, evidently felt this a 
great relief.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, it is a comfort to think some one will be within that poor 
thing&rsquo;s reach,&rsquo; said Bertha, as they went back together, 
&lsquo;and, if you can bear it, you are the right person.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She will not let herself dwell on it.&nbsp; She never even looked
at Mrs. Morton&rsquo;s letter.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And I really hope they won&rsquo;t find the poor little dear, to 
have all the fuss and heart-rending.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, Birdie!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There&rsquo;s only one thing that would make me wish it.&nbsp; 
I&rsquo;m quite sure that that Miss Ida knows more about it than she 
owns.&nbsp; No, you need not say, &ldquo;Oh, Birdie&rdquo; again; I 
don&rsquo;t suspect her of the deed, but I do believe she saw the boy and 
kept out of his way, and now wants that poor Ellen to have all the 
blame!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You will believe nothing against a girl out of an 
orphanage!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I had rather any day believe Ellen Mole than <!-- page 222--><a 
name="page222"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 222</span>Ida Morton.&nbsp; 
There&rsquo;s something about that girl which has always revolted me.&nbsp;
I would never trust her farther than I could see her!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Prejudice, Birdie; because she is in bad style.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You to talk of prejudice, Addie, who hardly knew how to go on 
living here under the poor stick!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t, Birdie.&nbsp; He has earned esteem by sheer 
goodness.&nbsp; Poor man, I don&rsquo;t know what to wish for him when I 
think of the pang that awaits him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You know what to wish for yourself and Northmoor!&nbsp; Not but 
that Herbert may come to good if he doesn&rsquo;t come into possession for 
many a long year.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And now I must write to that poor child, Constance.&nbsp; But oh,
Bertha, don&rsquo;t condemn hastily!&nbsp; Haven&rsquo;t I had enough of 
that?&rsquo;</p>
<h2><!-- page 223--><a name="page223"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

DARKNESS</h2>
<p>Full a week later, Frank looked up from his pillow, and said, &lsquo;I 
wonder when it will be safe to have Mite back.&nbsp; Mary, sweet, what is 
it?&nbsp; I have been sure something was burthening you.&nbsp; Come and 
tell me.&nbsp; If he has the fever, you must go to him.&nbsp; No!&rsquo; as
she clasped his hand and laid her face down on the pillow.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, Frank, he does not want us any more!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My Mary, my poor Mary, have you been bearing such knowledge about
with you?&nbsp; For how long?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Since that worst day, yesterday week.&nbsp; Oh, but to see you 
getting better was the help!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Can you tell me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>She told him, in that low, steady voice, all she knew.&nbsp; It was very
little, for she had avoided whatever might break the composure that seemed 
so needful to his recovery; and he could listen quietly, partly from the 
lulling effect of weakness, partly from his anxiety for her, and the habit 
of self-restraint, in which all the earlier part of their <!-- page 
224--><a name="page224"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 224</span>lives had 
been passed, made utterance come slowly to them.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Life will be different to us henceforth,&rsquo; he once 
said.&nbsp; &lsquo;We have had three years of the most perfect 
happiness.&nbsp; He gave and He hath taken away.&nbsp; 
Blessed&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>And there he stopped, for he saw the working of her face.&nbsp; 
Otherwise they hardly spoke of their loss even to one another.&nbsp; It 
went down deeper than they could bear to utter, and their hearts and eyes 
met if their lips did not.&nbsp; Only Lord Northmoor lay too dejected to 
make the steps expected in the recovery of strength for a few days after 
the grievous revelation, and on the day when at last he was placed on a 
couch by the window, his wife collapsed, and, almost unconscious, was 
carried to her bed.</p>
<p>It was not a severe or alarming attack, and all she wanted was to be let
alone; but there was enough of sore throat and other symptoms to prolong 
the quarantine, and Lady Adela could no longer be excluded from giving her 
aid.&nbsp; She went to and fro between the patients, and comforted each 
with regard to the other, telling the one how her husband&rsquo;s strength 
was returning, and keeping the other tranquil by the assurance that what 
his wife most needed was perfect rest, especially from the necessity of 
restraining herself.&nbsp; Those eyes showed how many tears were poured 
forth when they could have their free course.&nbsp; Lady Adela had gone 
through enough to feel with ready tact what would be least jarring to 
each.&nbsp; She had persuaded Bertha to go back to London, both to her many
avocations and to receive <!-- page 225--><a name="page225"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 225</span>Amice, who must still be kept at a distance 
for some time.</p>
<p>Lord Northmoor, as soon as he had strength and self-command for it, read
poor Mrs. Morton&rsquo;s letters, and also saw Eden, for whom there was 
little fear of infection.&nbsp; She managed to tell her history and answer 
all his questions in detail, but she quite broke down under his kind tone 
of forgiveness and assurance that no blame attached to her, and that he was
only grateful to her for her tender care of his child, and she went away 
sobbing pitifully.</p>
<p>Adela came back, after taking her from the room, where Frank was sitting
in an easy-chair by the window, and looking out on the summer garden, which
seemed to be stripped of all its charm and value for him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Poor thing,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;she is quite overcome by your
kindness.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I do not think any one is more to be pitied,&rsquo; said he.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, indeed, but she wishes you would have heard what she had to 
say about the supposing Ida to have gone in that direction.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I thought it better not.&nbsp; It would not have exonerated the 
poor little maid from carelessness, and there is no use in fostering a 
sense of injury or suspicion, when what is done cannot be undone,&rsquo; he
said wearily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Indeed you are quite right,&rsquo; said Adela earnestly.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;You know how to be in charity with all men.&nbsp; Oh, the needless 
misery of hasty unjust suspicions!&rsquo;&nbsp; Then as he looked up at 
her&mdash;&lsquo;Do you know our own story?&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 226--><a name="page226"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
226</span>&lsquo;Only the main facts.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I think you ought to know it.&nbsp; It accounts for so 
much!&rsquo; said she, moved partly by the need of utterance, and partly by
the sense that the turn of his thoughts might be good for him.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;You know what a passion for horses there has always been in this 
family.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I know&mdash;I could have had it if my life had begun more 
prosperously.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And you have done your best to save Herbert from it.&nbsp; Well, 
my Arthur had it to a great degree; and so indeed had Bertha.&nbsp; They 
were brought up to nothing else; Bertha was, I really think, a better judge
than her brother, she was not so reckless.&nbsp; They became intimate with 
a Captain Alder, who was in the barracks at Copington&mdash;much the 
nicest, as I used to think, of the set, though I was not very glad to see 
an attachment growing up between him and Bertha.&nbsp; There was always 
such a capacity of goodness in her that I longed to see her in the way of 
being raised altogether.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She has always been most kind to us.&nbsp; There is much to 
admire in her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Her present life has developed all that is best; 
but&mdash;&rsquo;&nbsp; She hesitated, wondering whether the good simple 
man were sensible of that warp in the nature that she had felt.&nbsp; She 
went on, &lsquo;Then she was a masterful, high-spirited girl, to whom it 
seemed inevitable to come to high words with any one about whom she 
cared.&nbsp; And I must say&mdash;she and my husband, while they were 
passionately fond of one another, seemed to have a sort of fascination in 
provoking one another, not only in words but in deeds.&nbsp; <!-- page 
227--><a name="page227"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 227</span>Ah, you can 
hardly believe it of her!&nbsp; How people get tamed!&nbsp; Well, Arthur 
bought a horse, a beautiful creature, but desperately vicious.&nbsp; 
Captain Alder had been with him when he first saw it, and admired it; but I
do not think gave an opinion against it.&nbsp; Bertha, however, from the 
moment she saw its eyes and ears, protested against it in her vehement 
way.&nbsp; I remember imploring her not to make Arthur defy her; but really
when they got into those moods, I don&rsquo;t think they could stop 
themselves, and she thought Captain Alder encouraged him.&nbsp; So Arthur 
went out on that fatal drive in the dog-cart, and no sooner were they out 
on the Colbeam road than the horse bolted, they came into collision with a 
hay waggon.&nbsp; And&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I know!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Captain Alder was thrown on the top of the hay and not 
hurt.&nbsp; He came to prepare me to receive Arthur, and then went up to 
the house.&nbsp; Bertha, poor girl, in her wild grief almost flew at 
him.&nbsp; It was all his doing, she said; he had egged Arthur on; she 
supposed Arthur had bets.&nbsp; In short, she knew not what she said; but 
he left the house, and never has been near her again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Were they engaged?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not quite formally, but they understood one another, and were 
waiting for a favourable moment with old Lord Northmoor, who was not easy 
to deal with, and it was far from being a good match anyway.&nbsp; We all 
thought, I believe, that the drive was the fault or rather the folly of 
Captain Alder, and Arthur was too ill to explain&mdash;unconscious at 
first&mdash;then not rousing himself.&nbsp; At last he asked <!-- page 
228--><a name="page228"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 228</span>for his 
friend, and then he told me that Captain Alder had done all in his power to
prevent his taking the creature out&mdash;had told him he had no right to 
endanger his life; and when only laughed at, had insisted on going with 
him, in hopes, I suppose, of averting mischief.&nbsp; I wrote&mdash;Lord 
Northmoor wrote to him at his quarters; but our letters came back to 
us.&nbsp; We had kept no watch on the gazette, and he had retired and left 
no address with his brother-officers.&nbsp; Bertha knew that his parents 
were dead, and that he had a sister at school at Clifton.&nbsp; I wrote to 
her, but the mistress sent back my letter; and we found that he had fetched
away his sister and gone.&nbsp; Even his money was taken from 
Coutts&rsquo;s, as if to cut off any clue.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He should not have so attended to a girl in her angry 
grief.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, but I think there was some self-blame in him, though not 
about that horse.&nbsp; I believe he thought he might have checked Arthur 
more.&nbsp; And he had debts which he seems to have paid on selling out his
capital.&nbsp; So, as I have told poor Bertha whenever she would let me, 
there may have been other reasons besides her stinging words.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And it has preyed on her?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;More than any one would guess who had not known her in old 
times.&nbsp; I was glad that you secured that child, Cea, to her.&nbsp; She
seems to have fastened her affections on her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Alder,&rsquo; presently repeated Frank.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;Alder&mdash;I was thinking how the name had come before me.&nbsp; 
There were some clients of ours&mdash;of Mr. Burford&rsquo;s, I 
mean&mdash;of that name; I think they sold an estate.&nbsp; <!-- page 
229--><a name="page229"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 229</span>Some day I 
will find out whether he knows anything about them, and I shall remember 
more by and by.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It would be an immense relief if you could find out anything good
about the poor fellow,&rsquo; said Adela, very glad to have found any topic
of interest, and pleased to find that it occupied his thoughts afterwards, 
when he asked whether she knew the Christian name of <i>this</i> young man,
without mentioning any antecedent, as if he had been going on with the 
subject all the time.</p>
<p>In a few days the pair were able to meet, and to take up again the life 
over which a dark veil had suddenly descended, contrasting with the 
sunshine of those last few years.&nbsp; To hold up one another, and do 
their duty on their way to the better world, was evidently the one thought,
though they said little.</p>
<p>Still neither was yet in a condition to return to ordinary life, and it 
was determined that as soon as they were disinfected, they should leave the
house to undergo the same process, and spend a few weeks at some health 
resort.&nbsp; Only Mary shuddered at the notion of hearing the sound of the
sea, and Malvern was finally fixed upon.&nbsp; Lady Adela would go with 
them, and she wrote to beg that Constance, so soon as her term was over, 
might bring Amice thither, to be in a separate lodging at first, till there
had been time to see whether the little girl&rsquo;s company would be a 
solace or a trial to the bereaved parents.</p>
<p>Bertha, as soon as the chief anxiety was over, joined Mrs. Bury in a 
mountaineering expedition.&nbsp; She declared that she had never dared to 
leave Cea before, lest the wretched father, now proved to be a myth, should
come and abstract the child.</p>

THE PHANTOM OF THE STATION</h2>
<p>There was a crash in Mrs. Morton&rsquo;s kitchen, where an elegant five 
o&rsquo;clock tea was preparing, not only to greet Herbert, who had just 
come home to await the news of his fate after the last military examination
open to him, but also for a friend or two of his mother&rsquo;s, who, to 
his great annoyance, might be expected to drop in on any Wednesday 
afternoon.</p>
<p>Every one ran out to see what was the matter, and the maid was found 
picking up Mrs. Morton&rsquo;s silver teapot, the basket-work handle of 
which had suddenly collapsed under the weight of tea and tea-leaves.&nbsp; 
The mistress&rsquo;s exclamations and objurgation of the maid for not 
having discovered its frail condition need not be repeated.&nbsp; It had 
been a wedding-present, and was her great pride.&nbsp; After due 
examination to see whether there were any bruises or dents, she 
said&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, Ida, we must have yours; run and fetch it out of the 
box.&nbsp; You have the key of it.&rsquo;&nbsp; And she held out the key of
the cupboard where the spoons were daily taken out by herself or Ida.</p>
<p><!-- page 231--><a name="page231"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
231</span>The teapot had been left to Ida by a godmother, who had been a 
farmer&rsquo;s wife, with a small legacy, but was of an unfashionable make 
and seldom saw the light.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That horrid, great clumsy thing!&rsquo; said Ida.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;You had much better use the blue china one.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll never use that crockery for company when there&rsquo;s
silver in the house!&nbsp; What would Mrs. Denham say if she dropped 
in?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I won&rsquo;t pour out tea in that ugly, heavy brute of a 
thing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then if you won&rsquo;t, I will.&nbsp; Give me the key this 
instant!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is mine, and I am not going to give it up!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Come, Ida,&rsquo; said Herbert, weary of the altercation; 
&lsquo;any one would think you had made away with it!&nbsp; Let us have it 
for peace&rsquo;s sake.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s no business of yours.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He whistled.&nbsp; However, at that moment the door-bell rang.</p>
<p>It was to admit a couple of old ladies, whom both the young people 
viewed as very dull company; and the story of the illness of &lsquo;my 
brother, Lord Northmoor,&rsquo; as related by their mother, had become very
tedious, so that as soon as possible they both sauntered out on the 
beach.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I wonder when uncle will send for you!&rsquo; Ida said.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;He must give you a good allowance now.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t talk of it, Ida; it makes me sick to think of 
it.&nbsp; I say&mdash;is that the old red rock where they saw the last of 
the poor little kid?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes; that was where his hat was.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did you find it?&nbsp; Was it washed up?&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 232--><a name="page232"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
232</span>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t talk of such dreadful things, Bertie; I 
can&rsquo;t bear it!&nbsp; And there&rsquo;s Rose Rollstone!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ida would have done her utmost to keep her brother and Rose Rollstone 
apart at any other time, but she was at the moment only too glad to divert 
his attention, and allowed him, without protest, to walk up to Rose, shake 
hands with her, and rejoice in her coming home for good; but, do what Ida 
would, she could not keep him from recurring to the thought of the little 
cousin of whom he had been very fond.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Such a jolly little kid!&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;and full of 
spirit!&nbsp; You should have seen him when I picked him up before me on 
the cob.&nbsp; How he laughed!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;So good, too,&rsquo; said Rose.&nbsp; &lsquo;He looked so sweet 
with those pretty brown eyes and fair curls at church that last 
Sunday.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I can&rsquo;t make out how it was.&nbsp; The tide could not have 
been high enough to wash him off going round that rock, or the other 
children would not have gone round it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, I suppose he ran after a wave,&rsquo; said Ida hastily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do you know,&rsquo; said Rose mysteriously, &lsquo;I could have 
declared I saw him that very evening, and with his nursery-maid, 
too!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nonsense, Rose!&nbsp; We don&rsquo;t believe in ghosts!&rsquo; 
said Ida.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was not like a ghost,&rsquo; said Rose.&nbsp; &lsquo;You know 
I had come down for the bank-holiday, and went back to finish my quarter at
the art embroidery.&nbsp; Well, when we stopped at the North Westhaven 
station, I saw a man, woman, and child get <!-- page 233--><a 
name="page233"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 233</span>in, and it struck me 
that the boy was Master Michael and the woman Louisa Hall.&nbsp; I think 
she looked into the carriage where I was, and I was going to ask her where 
she was taking him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nonsense, Rose!&nbsp; How can you listen to such folly, 
Herbert?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But that&rsquo;s not all!&nbsp; I saw them again under the gas 
when I got out.&nbsp; I was very near trying to speak to her, but I lost 
sight of her in the throng; but I saw that face so like Master Michael, 
only scared and just ready to cry.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;ll run about telling that fine ghost-story,&rsquo; said
Ida roughly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But Louisa could not have been a ghost,&rsquo; said Rose, 
bewildered.&nbsp; &lsquo;I thought she was his nursery-maid taking him 
somewhere!&nbsp; Didn&rsquo;t she&mdash;&rsquo; then with a sudden 
flash&mdash;&lsquo;Oh!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Turned off long ago for flirting with that scamp Rattler,&rsquo; 
said Herbert.&nbsp; &lsquo;Now she has run off with him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There was a sailor-looking man with her,&rsquo; said Rose.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I never heard such intolerable nonsense!&rsquo; burst out 
Ida.&nbsp; &lsquo;Mere absurdity!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Herbert looked at her with surprise at the strange passion she 
exhibited.&nbsp; He asked&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did you say the Hall girl had run away?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, never mind, Herbert!&rsquo; cried Ida, as if unable to 
command herself.&nbsp; &lsquo;What is it to you what a nasty, horrid girl 
like that does?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hold your tongue, Ida!&rsquo; he said resolutely.&nbsp; &lsquo;If
you won&rsquo;t speak, let Rose.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She did,&rsquo; said Rose, in a low, anxious, terrified <!-- page
234--><a name="page234"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 234</span>voice.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I only heard it since I came home.&nbsp; She was married at the 
registrar&rsquo;s office to that man Jones, whom they call the Rattler, and
went off with him.&nbsp; It must have been her whom I saw, really and 
truly; and, oh, Herbert, could she have been so wicked as to steal Master 
Michael!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Somebody else has been wicked then,&rsquo; said Herbert, laying 
hold of his sister&rsquo;s arm.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know what all this means,&rsquo; exclaimed Ida, in 
great agitation; &lsquo;nor what you and Rose are at!&nbsp; Making up such 
horrible, abominable insinuations against me, your poor sister!&nbsp; But 
Rose Rollstone always hated me!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She does not know what she is saying,&rsquo; sighed Rose; and, 
with much delicacy, she moved away.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Let me go, Herbert!&rsquo; cried Ida, as she felt his grip on her
hand.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not I, Ida&mdash;till you have answered me!&nbsp; Is this 
so&mdash;that Michael is not drowned, but carried off by that woman?&rsquo;
demanded Herbert, holding her fast and looking at her with manly gravity, 
not devoid of horror.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He is a horrid little impostor, palmed off to keep you out of the
title and everything!&nbsp; That&rsquo;s why I did it!&rsquo; sobbed Ida, 
trying to wrench herself away.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, you did it, did you?&nbsp; You confess that!&nbsp; And what 
have you done with him?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I tell you he is no Morton at all&mdash;just the 
nurse-woman&rsquo;s child, taken to spite you.&nbsp; I found it all out 
at&mdash;what&rsquo;s its name?&mdash;Botzen; only ma would not be 
convinced.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I should suppose not!&nbsp; To think that my <!-- page 235--><a 
name="page235"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 235</span>uncle and aunt would 
do such a thing&mdash;why, I don&rsquo;t know whether it is not worse than 
stealing the child!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Herbert!&nbsp; Herbert! do you want to bring your sister to jail,
talking in that way?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is no more than you deserve.&nbsp; I <i>would</i> bring you 
there if it is the only way to get back the child!&nbsp; I do not know what
is bad enough for you.&nbsp; My poor uncle and aunt!&nbsp; To have brought 
such misery on them!&rsquo;&nbsp; He clenched his hands as he spoke.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Everybody said she didn&rsquo;t mind&mdash;didn&rsquo;t ask 
questions, didn&rsquo;t cry, didn&rsquo;t go on a bit like his real 
mother.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She could not, or it might have been the death of my uncle.&nbsp;
Bertha wrote it all to me; but you&mdash;you would never understand.&nbsp; 
Ida, I can&rsquo;t believe that you, my sister, could have done such an 
awfully wicked thing!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t, only I was sure he was not&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No more of that stuff!&rsquo; said Herbert.&nbsp; &lsquo;You 
don&rsquo;t know what they are.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I do.&nbsp; So strict&mdash;not a bit like a mother.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If our mother had been like them, you might not have been such a 
senseless monster,&rsquo; said Herbert, pausing for a word.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;Come, now; tell me what you have done with him, or I shall have to 
set on the police.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, Herbert, how can you be so cruel?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is not I that am cruel!&nbsp; Come, speak out!&nbsp; Did you 
bribe her with your teapot?&nbsp; Ah! I see: what has she done with 
him?&rsquo;</p>
<p>He gripped her arm almost as he used to torture <!-- page 236--><a 
name="page236"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 236</span>her when they were 
children, and insisted again that either she must tell him the whole truth 
or he should set the police on the track.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t,&rsquo; she said, awed.&nbsp; &lsquo;Think of 
the exposure and of mother!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I can think of nothing but saving Mite!&nbsp; I say&mdash;my 
mother knows nothing of this?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh no, no!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Herbert breathed more freely, but he was firm, and seemed suddenly to 
have grown out of boyishness into manly determination, and gradually he 
extracted the whole story from her.&nbsp; He would not listen to the 
delusion in which she had worked herself into believing, founded upon the 
negations for which she had sedulously avoided seeking positive refutation,
and which had been bolstered up by her imagination and wishes, working on 
the unsubstantial precedents of novels.&nbsp; She had brought herself 
absolutely to believe in the imposture, and at a moment when her 
uncle&rsquo;s condition seemed absolutely to place within her grasp the 
coronet for Herbert, with all possibilities for herself.</p>
<p>Then came the idea of Louisa Hall, inspired by seeing her speak to 
little Michael on the beach, and obtain his pretty smiles and exclamation 
of &lsquo;Lou, Lou! mine Lou!&rsquo; for he had certainly liked this girl 
better than Ellen, who was wanting in life and animation.&nbsp; Ida knew 
that Sam Jones, alias Rattler, was going out to join his brother in Canada,
and that Louisa was vehemently desirous to accompany him, but had failed to
satisfy the requirements of Government as to character, so as to obtain a 
free passage, and was therefore about to be left behind <!-- page 237--><a 
name="page237"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 237</span>in desertion and 
distress.&nbsp; She might beguile Michael away quietly and carry him to 
Canada, where, as it seemed, there were any amount of farmers ready to 
adopt English children&mdash;a much better lot, in Ida&rsquo;s eyes, than 
the little Tyrolese impostor deserved.&nbsp; She even persuaded herself 
that she was doing an act of great goodness, when, at the price of her 
teapot, she obtained that Louisa should be married by the registrar to Sam 
Jones, and their passage paid, on condition of their carrying away Michael 
with them.&nbsp; The man was nothing loth, having really a certain 
preference for Louisa, and likewise a grudge against Lord Northmoor for 
having spoilt that game with Miss Morton, which might have brought the 
means for the voyage.</p>
<p>They were married on Whit Monday, and Ida was warned that if she and 
Louisa could not get possession of the child by Wednesday, he would be left
behind.&nbsp; Louisa was accordingly on the watch, and Ida hovered about, 
just enough completely to put the nurses off their guard.&nbsp; They heard 
Michael&rsquo;s imploring call of &lsquo;Willie!&nbsp; Willie!&rsquo; and 
then Louisa descended on him with coaxings and promises, and Ida knew no 
more, except that, as she had desired, a parcel had been sent her 
containing the hat and shoes.&nbsp; The spade she had herself picked 
up.</p>
<p>When Rose had seen them, they had no doubt been on their way to 
Liverpool.</p>
<p>It seemed to be Herbert&rsquo;s horror-stricken look that first showed 
his sister the enormity of what she had done, and when she pleaded 
&lsquo;for your sake,&rsquo; he made such a fierce sound of disgust, that 
she only durst add further, &lsquo;Oh, Herbert, you will not 
tell?&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 238--><a name="page238"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
238</span>&lsquo;Not find him?&rsquo; he thundered.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, no; I didn&rsquo;t mean that!&nbsp; But don&rsquo;t let them 
know about me!&nbsp; Just think&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I must think!&nbsp; Get away now; I can&rsquo;t bear you 
near!&rsquo;</p>
<p>And just then a voice was heard, &lsquo;Miss Hider, Miss Hider, your ma 
wants you!&rsquo;</p>
<h2><!-- page 239--><a name="page239"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
239</span>CHAPTER XXXV<br />
THE QUEST</h2>
<p>Herbert had made no promises, but as he paced up and down the shingle 
after his sister had gone in, he had time to feel that, though he was 
determined to act at once, the scandal of her deed must be as much as 
possible avoided.&nbsp; Indeed, he believed that she might have rendered 
herself amenable to prosecution for kidnapping the child, and he felt on 
reflection that his mother must be spared the terror and disgrace.&nbsp; 
His difficulties were much increased by the state of quarantine at 
Northmoor, for though the journey to Malvern had been decided upon, neither
patient was yet in a state to attempt it, and as one of the servants had 
unexpectedly sickened with the disease, all approach to the place was 
forbidden; nor did he know with any certainty how far his uncle&rsquo;s 
recovery had advanced, since Bertha, his chief informant, had gone abroad 
with Mrs. Bury, and Constance was still at Oxford.</p>
<p>He went home, and straight up to his room, feeling it intolerable to 
meet his sister; and there, the first sleepless night he had ever known, 
convinced <!-- page 240--><a name="page240"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
240</span>him that to the convalescents it would be cruelty to send his 
intelligence, when it amounted to no more than that their poor little boy 
had been made over to an unscrupulous woman and a violent, good-for-nothing
man.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Herbert, as he tossed over; &lsquo;it would be 
worse than believing him quietly dead, now they have settled down to 
that.&nbsp; I must get him back before they know anything about it.&nbsp; 
But how?&nbsp; I must hunt up those wretches&rsquo; people here, and find 
where they are gone; if they know&mdash;as like as not they 
won&rsquo;t.&nbsp; But I&rsquo;ll throw everything up till I find the 
boy!&rsquo;&nbsp; He knelt up in his bed, laid his hand on his 
Bible&mdash;his uncle&rsquo;s gift&mdash;and solemnly swore it.</p>
<p>And Herbert was another youth from that hour.</p>
<p>When he had brought his ideas into some little order, the foremost was 
that he must see Rose Rollstone, discover how much she knew or guessed, and
bind her to silence.&nbsp; &lsquo;No fear of her, jolly little 
thing!&rsquo; said he to himself; but, playfellows as they had been, 
private interviews were not easy to secure under present circumstances.</p>
<p>However, the tinkling of the bell of the iron church suggested an 
idea.&nbsp; &lsquo;She is just the little saint of a thing to be always off
to church at unearthly hours.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll catch her there&mdash;if 
only that black coat isn&rsquo;t always after her!&rsquo;</p>
<p>So Herbert hurried off to the iron building, satisfied himself with a 
peep that Rose&rsquo;s sailor hat was there, and then&mdash;to make sure of
her&mdash;crept into a seat by the door, and found his plans none the worse
for praying for all needing help in mind, body, or estate.&nbsp; Rose came 
out alone, and he was <!-- page 241--><a name="page241"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 241</span>by her side at once.&nbsp; &lsquo;I say, Rose,
you did not speak about <i>that</i> last night?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh no, indeed!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;re a brick!&nbsp; I got it all out of that sister of 
mine.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m only ashamed that she is my sister!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And where is the dear little boy?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s the point,&rsquo; and Herbert briefly explained his 
difficulties, and Rose agreed that he must try to learn where the emigrants
had gone, from their relations.&nbsp; And when he expressed his full 
intention of following them, even if he had to work his passage, before 
telling the parents, she applauded the nobleness of the resolution, and all
the romance in her awoke at the notion of his bringing home the boy and 
setting him before his parents.&nbsp; She was ready to promise secrecy for 
the sake of preventing the prosecution that might, as Herbert saw, be a 
terrible thing for the whole family; and besides, it must be confessed, the
two young things did rather enjoy the sharing of a secret.&nbsp; Herbert 
promised to meet her the next morning, and report his discoveries and 
plans, as in fact she was the only person with whom he could take 
counsel.</p>
<p>He did meet her accordingly, going first to the church.&nbsp; He had to 
tell her that he had been able to make nothing of Mrs. Hall.&nbsp; He was 
not sure whether she knew where her daughter had gone; at any rate, she 
would not own to any knowledge, being probably afraid.&nbsp; Besides, when 
acting as charwoman, Master Herbert had been such a torment to her that she
was not likely to oblige him.</p>
<p>He had succeeded better with the Jones family, and perhaps had learnt 
prudence, for he had not <!-- page 242--><a name="page242"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 242</span>begun by asking for the Rattler, but for the 
respectable brother who had invited him out, and had thus learnt that the 
destination of the emigrant was Toronto, where the elder brother was 
employed on the <i>British Empress</i>, Ontario steamer.&nbsp; Mrs. Jones, 
the mother, and her eldest son were decent people, and there was no reason 
to think they were aware of the encumbrances that their scapegrace had 
taken with him.</p>
<p>So Herbert had resolved, without delay, to make his way to Toronto; 
where he hoped to find the child, and maybe, bring him back in a 
month&rsquo;s time.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Only,&rsquo; said Rose timidly, &lsquo;did you really mean what 
you said about working your way out?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, Rose, that&rsquo;s the hitch.&nbsp; I had to pay up some 
bills after I got my allowance, and unluckily I changed my bicycle, and the
rascals put a lot more on the new one, and I haven&rsquo;t got above seven 
pounds left, and I must keep some for the rail from New York and for 
getting home, for I can&rsquo;t take the kid home in the steerage.&nbsp; 
The bicycle&rsquo;s worth something, and so is my watch, if I put them in 
pawn; so I think I can do it that way, and I&rsquo;m quite seaman enough to
get employment, only I don&rsquo;t want to lose time about it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I was thinking,&rsquo; said Rose shyly; &lsquo;they made me put 
into the Post Office Savings Bank after I began to get a salary.&nbsp; I 
have five-and-twenty pounds there that I could get out in a couple of days,
and I should be so glad to help to bring that dear little boy 
home.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, Rose, you <i>are</i> a girl!&nbsp; You see, you are <!-- page
243--><a name="page243"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 243</span>quite safe 
not to lose it, for my uncle would be only too glad to pay it back, even if
I came to grief any way, and it would make it all slick smooth.&nbsp; I 
would go to Liverpool straight off, and cross in the first steamer, and the
thing&rsquo;s done.&nbsp; And can you get at it at once with nobody 
knowing?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, I think so,&rsquo; said Rose.&nbsp; &lsquo;My father asked 
to see my book when first I came home, and he is not likely to do so again,
till I can explain all about it, and I am sure it cannot be 
wrong.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Wrong&mdash;no!&nbsp; Right as a trivet!&nbsp; Rose, Rose, if 
ever that poor child sees his father and mother again, it is every bit your
doing!&nbsp; No one can tell what I think of it, or what my uncle and aunt 
will say to you!&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve been the angel in this, if Ida has been
the other thing!&rsquo;</p>
<p>But Rose found difficulties in the way of her angelic part, for her 
father addressed her in his most solemn and sententious manner: 
&lsquo;Rose, I have always looked on you as sensible and discreet, but I 
have to say that I disapprove of your late promenades with a young man 
connected with the aristocracy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Rose coloured up a good deal, but cried out, &lsquo;It&rsquo;s not that,
papa, not that!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I do not suppose either you or he is capable at present of 
forming any definite purpose,&rsquo; said Mr. Rollstone, not to be baulked 
of his discourse; &lsquo;but you must bear in mind that any appearance of 
encouragement to a young man in his position can only have a most damaging 
effect on your prospects, and even reputation, however flattering he may 
appear.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 244--><a name="page244"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
244</span>&lsquo;I know it, papa, I know it!&nbsp; There has been nothing 
of the kind, I assure you,&rsquo; said Rose, who during the last discourse 
had had time to reflect; &lsquo;and he is going away to-morrow or next day,
so you need not be afraid, though I must see him or send to him once more 
before he goes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, if you are helping him to get some present for his sisters,
I do not see so much objection for this once; only it must not occur 
again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Rose was much tempted to let this suggestion stand, but truth forbade 
her, and she said, &lsquo;No, papa, I cannot say it is that; but you will 
know all about it before long, and you will not disapprove, if you will 
only trust your little Rose,&rsquo; and she looked up for a kiss.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, I never found you not to be trusted, though you are a 
coaxing puss,&rsquo; said her father, and so the matter ended with him, but
she had another encounter with her mother.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mind, Rose, if that churching&mdash;which Sunday was enough for 
any good girl in my time&mdash;is only to lead to walking with young gents 
which has no call to you, I won&rsquo;t have it done.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Rollstone was not cultivated up to her husband&rsquo;s mark, 
neither had she ever inspired so much confidence, and Rose made simple 
answer, &lsquo;It is all right, mamma; I have spoken to papa about 
it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, if your pa knows, I suppose he is satisfied; but men 
aren&rsquo;t the same as a mother, and if that there young Mr. Morton comes
dangling and gallanting after you, he is after no good.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He is doing no such thing,&rsquo; said Rose in a <!-- page 
245--><a name="page245"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 245</span>resolutely 
calm voice that might have shown that she was with difficulty controlling 
her temper; &lsquo;and, besides, he is going away.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Wherewith Mrs. Rollstone had to be satisfied.</p>
<p>Rose took a bold measure when she had taken her five five-pound notes 
from the savings bank.&nbsp; She saw her father preparing to waddle out for
his daily turn on the beach, and she put the envelope containing them, 
addressed to H. Morton, Esq., into his hand, begging him to give it to Mr. 
Morton himself.</p>
<p>Which he did, when he met Herbert trying to soothe his impatience with a
cigar.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Here, sir,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;my daughter wishes me to give 
you this.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t ask what it is, mind; but I tell you plainly,
I don&rsquo;t like secrets between young people.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Herbert tried to laugh naturally, then said, &lsquo;Your daughter is no 
end of a trump, Mr. Rollstone.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Only recollect this, sir&mdash;I know my station and I know 
yours, and I will have no nonsense with her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;All right!&rsquo; said Herbert shortly, with a laugh, his head 
too full of other matters to think what all this implied.</p>
<p>He wished to avoid exciting any disturbance, so he told his mother that 
he should be off again the next day.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is very hard,&rsquo; grumbled Mrs. Morton, &lsquo;that you can
never be contented to stay with your poor mother!&nbsp; I did hope that 
with the regatta, and the yachts, and Mr. Brady, you would find amusement 
enough to give us a little of your company; <!-- page 246--><a 
name="page246"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 246</span>but nothing is good 
enough for you now.&nbsp; Which of your fine friends are you going 
to?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Herbert was not superior to an evasion, and said, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m going
up to town first, and shall see Dacre, and I&rsquo;ll write by and 
by.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She resigned herself to the erratic movements of the son, who, being 
again, in her eyes, heir to the peerage, was to her like a comet in a 
higher sphere.</p>

IDA&rsquo;S CONFESSION</h2>
<p>The move to Malvern was at last made, and the air seemed at once to 
invigorate Lord Northmoor, though the journey tried his wife more than she 
had expected, and she remained in a very drooping state, in spite of her 
best efforts not to depress him.&nbsp; Nothing seemed to suit her so well 
as to lie on a couch in the garden of their lodging, with Constance beside 
her, talking, and sometimes smiling over all her little Mite&rsquo;s pretty
ways; though at other times she did her best to seem to take interest in 
other matters, and to persuade her husband that his endeavours to give her 
pleasure or interest were successful, because the exertions he made for her
sake were good for him.</p>
<p>He was by this time anxious&mdash;since he was by the end of three weeks
quite well, and fairly strong&mdash;to go down to Westhaven, and learn all 
he could about the circumstances of the fate of his poor little son; and 
only delayed till he thought his wife could spare him.&nbsp; Lady Adela 
urged him at last to go.&nbsp; She thought that Mary lived in a state of 
<!-- page 248--><a name="page248"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
248</span>effort for his sake, and that there was a certain yearning and 
yet dread in the minds of both for these further details, so that the visit
had better be over.</p>
<p>Thus it was about six weeks after Herbert&rsquo;s departure that Mrs. 
Morton received a note to tell her that her brother-in-law would arrive the
next evening.&nbsp; It was terrible news to Ida, and if there had been time
she would have arranged to be absent elsewhere; but as it was she had no 
power to escape, and had to spend her time in assisting in all the 
elaborate preparations which her mother thought due to the Baron&mdash;a 
very different personage in her eyes from the actual Frank.</p>
<p>He did not come till late in the day, and then Mrs. Morton received him 
with a very genuine gush of tears, and anxious inquiries.&nbsp; He was 
thin, and looked much older; his hair was grayer, and had retreated from 
his brow, and there was a bent, worn, dejected air about the whole man, 
which, as Mrs. Morton said, made her ready to cry whenever she looked at 
him; but he was quite composed in manner and tone, so as to repress her 
agitation, and confirm Ida&rsquo;s inexperienced judgment in the idea that 
Michael was none of his.&nbsp; He was surprised and concerned at 
Herbert&rsquo;s absence, which was beginning to make his mother uneasy, and
he promised to write to some of the boy&rsquo;s friends to inquire about 
him.&nbsp; To put off the evil day, Ida had suggested asking Mr. Deyncourt 
to meet him, but that gentleman could not come, and dinner went off in 
stiff efforts at conversation, for just now all the power thereof, that 
Lord Northmoor had ever acquired, seemed to have forsaken him.</p>
<p><!-- page 249--><a name="page249"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
249</span>Afterwards, in the August twilight, he begged to hear all.&nbsp; 
Ida withdrew, glad not to submit to the ordeal, while her mother observed, 
&lsquo;Poor, dear Ida!&nbsp; She was so fond of her dear little cousin, she
cannot bear to hear him mentioned!&nbsp; She has never been well 
since!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Then, with copious floods of tears, and all in perfect good faith, she 
related the history of the loss, as she knew it, with&mdash;on his leading 
questions&mdash;a full account of all the child&rsquo;s pretty ways during 
his stay, and how he had never failed to say his prayer about making papa 
better, and how he had made friends with Mr. Deyncourt, in spite of having 
pronounced his church like a big tin box all up in frills; and how he had 
admired the crabs, and run after the waves, and had been devoted to the 
Willie, who had thought him troublesome&mdash;giving all the anecdotes, to 
which Frank listened with set face and dry eyes, storing them for his 
wife.&nbsp; He thanked Mrs. Morton for all her care and tenderness, and 
expended assurances that no one thought her to blame.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is one of those dispensations,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;that no 
one can guard against.&nbsp; We can only be thankful for the years of joy 
that no one can take from us, and try to be worthy to meet him 
hereafter.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Morton had wept so much that she was very glad to seize the first 
excuse for wishing good-night.&nbsp; She said that she had put all 
Michael&rsquo;s little things in a box in his father&rsquo;s room, for him 
to take home to his mother, and bade Frank&mdash;as once more she called 
him&mdash;good-night, kissing him as she had never done before.&nbsp; The 
shock had brought out all that was best and most womanly in her.</p>
<p><!-- page 250--><a name="page250"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
250</span>That box had an irresistible attraction for Frank.&nbsp; He could
not but open it, and on the top lay the white woolly, headless dog that had
been Mite&rsquo;s special darling, had been hugged by him in his slumbers 
every night, and been the means of many a joyous game when father and 
mother came up to wish the noisy creature good-night, and 
&lsquo;Tarlo&rsquo; had been made to bark at them.</p>
<p>Somehow the &lsquo;never more&rsquo; overcame him completely.&nbsp; He 
had not before been beyond the restraint of guarding his feelings for 
Mary&rsquo;s sake; and, tired with the long day, and torn by the 
evening&rsquo;s narration, all his self-command gave way, and he fell into 
a perfect anguish of deep-drawn, almost hysterical sobbing.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p250.jpg">
<img alt="&lsquo;What?&rsquo; and he threw the door wide open" 
src="images/p250.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>Those sobs were heard through the thin partition in Ida&rsquo;s 
room.&nbsp; They were very terrible to her.&nbsp; They broke down the 
remnant of her excuse that the child was an imposition.&nbsp; They woke all
her woman&rsquo;s tenderness, and the impulse to console carried her in a 
few moments to the door.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Uncle!&nbsp; Uncle Frank!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m not ill,&rsquo; answered a broken, heaving, impatient 
voice.&nbsp; &lsquo;I want nothing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, let me in, dear uncle&mdash;I&rsquo;ve something to tell 
you!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not now,&rsquo; came on the back of a sob.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;Go!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, now, now!&rsquo; and she even opened the door a little.&nbsp;
&lsquo;He is not drowned!&nbsp; At least, Rose Rollstone 
thinks&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What?&rsquo; and he threw the door wide open.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Rose Rollstone is sure she saw him with Louisa Hall in London 
that day,&rsquo; hurried out Ida, still bent <!-- page 251--><a 
name="page251"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 251</span>on screening 
herself.&nbsp; &lsquo;She&rsquo;s gone to Canada.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s there 
that Herbert is gone to find him and bring him home!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And why&mdash;why were we never told?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You were too ill, uncle, and Rose did not know about it till she 
came home.&nbsp; Then she told Herbert, and he hoped to find him and 
write.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;When was this?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;When Herbert came home&mdash;the 29th or 30th of June,&rsquo; 
said Ida, trembling.&nbsp; &lsquo;He <i>must</i> find him, uncle; 
don&rsquo;t fear!&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was a strange groaning sigh that answered; then, with a great 
effort&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank you, Ida; I can&rsquo;t understand it yet&mdash;I 
can&rsquo;t talk!&nbsp; Good-night!&rsquo;&nbsp; Then, with an 
afterthought, when he had almost shut his door, he turned the handle again 
to say, &lsquo;Who did you say saw&mdash;thought she saw&mdash;my 
boy?&nbsp; Where?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Rose Rollstone, uncle; first at the North Station&mdash;then at 
Waterloo!&nbsp; And Louisa Hall too!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I thank you; good-night!&rsquo;</p>
<p>And for what a night of strange dreams, prayers, and uncertainties did 
Frank shut himself in&mdash;only forcing himself by resolute will into 
sleeping at last, because he knew that strength and coolness were needful 
for to-morrow&rsquo;s investigation.</p>
<h2><!-- page 252--><a name="page252"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
252</span>CHAPTER XXXVII<br />
HOPE</h2>
<p>That last sleep lasted long, till the sound of the little tinkling bell 
came through the open window, and then the first waking thought that Mite 
was alive was at first taken for a mere blissful dream.&nbsp; It was only 
the sight of the woolly dog that recalled with certainty the conversation 
with Ida.</p>
<p>To pursue that strange hint was of course the one impulse.&nbsp; The 
bell had ceased before Frank had been able to finish dressing, but the 
house was so far from having wakened to full life, that remembering the 
lateness of the breakfast hour, he decided on hastening out to lay his 
anxious, throbbing feelings before his God, if only to join in the prayer 
that our desires may be granted as may be most expedient for us.</p>
<p>Nor was he without a hope that the girl whom Constance described as so 
devout and religious might be found there.</p>
<p>And she was; he knew her by sight well enough to accost her when she 
came out with &lsquo;Miss Rollstone, I believe?&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 253--><a name="page253"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
253</span>She bowed, her heart thumping almost as much as the 
father&rsquo;s, in the importance of what she had to tell, and the doubt 
how much she had a right to speak without betrayal.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am told,&rsquo; Lord Northmoor said, with a tremble in his 
voice, &lsquo;that you think you saw my poor little boy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am almost sure I did,&rsquo; said Rose.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And when, may I ask?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;On the evening of the Wednesday in Whitsun week,&rsquo; said 
Rose.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Just when he was lost&mdash;and where?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;At the North Station.&nbsp; I had got into the train at the main 
station.&nbsp; I saw him put into the train at the North one, and taken out
at Waterloo.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And why&mdash;why, may I ask, have we been left&mdash;have we 
never heard this before?&rsquo;</p>
<p>His voice shook, as he thought of all the misery to himself and his wife
that might have been spared, as well as the danger of the child.&nbsp; Rose
hesitated, doubting how much she ought to say, and Mr. Deyncourt came 
out.</p>
<p>&lsquo;May I introduce myself?&rsquo; said Frank, hoping for an 
auxiliary,&mdash;&lsquo;Lord Northmoor.&nbsp; I have just heard that Miss 
Rollstone thinks she saw my little boy in the London train the day he 
disappeared; and I am trying to understand whether there is really any hope
that she is right, and that we can recover him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Deyncourt was infinitely surprised, and spoke a few words of wonder 
that this had not been made known.&nbsp; Rose found it easier to speak to 
him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I saw Louisa Hall with him; I did not know she was not still his 
maid.&nbsp; I thought she had <!-- page 254--><a name="page254"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 254</span>been sent to take him somewhere.&nbsp; And 
when I heard from home that he&mdash;he was&mdash;drowned, I only thought 
the likeness had deceived me.&nbsp; It was not till Mr. Morton came home, 
and we talked it over, that I understood that Louisa Hall was dismissed 
long ago, and was eloping to Canada.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And then,&rsquo; for she had spoken falteringly, and with an 
effort, as their sounds of inquiry elicited each sentence&mdash;&lsquo;and 
then, Mr. Morton said he would follow her to Canada.&nbsp; He did not want 
Lady Northmoor to be tortured with uncertainty.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very strange,&rsquo; said the gentlemen one to the other, Lord 
Northmoor adding&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank you, Miss Rollstone; I will not detain you, unless you can 
tell me more.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Rose was glad to be released, though pained and vexed not to dare to 
express her reasons for full certainty.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is this only a girl&rsquo;s fancy?&rsquo; sighed the father.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I think she is a sensible girl.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And my nephew Herbert is a hard-headed fellow, not likely to fly 
off on a vague notion.&nbsp; Is this Hall girl&rsquo;s mother still living 
here?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Certainly.&nbsp; It has been a bad business, her going off with 
that Jones; but I ascertained that she was married to him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Jones&mdash;Sam Jones, or Rattler?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Even so.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah!&nbsp; She was dismissed on his account.&nbsp; And I detected 
him in imposing on Miss Morton.&nbsp; Yet&mdash;where does this Mrs. Hall 
live?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Along this alley.&nbsp; Shall I come with you?&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 255--><a name="page255"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
255</span>&lsquo;Thank you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It may induce her to speak out, if there is anything to 
hear.&nbsp; I dare not hope!&nbsp; It is too incredible, and I don&rsquo;t 
understand those children&rsquo;s silence.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He spoke it almost to himself, and the clergyman thought it kinder not 
to interrupt his thoughts during the few steps down the evil-smelling alley
that led to the house, where Mrs. Hall was washing up her cup after 
breakfast.&nbsp; It was Mr. Deyncourt who spoke, seeing that the swelling 
hope and doubt were almost too much for his companion.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Good morning, Mrs. Hall; we have come to you early, but Lord 
Northmoor is very anxious to know whether you can throw any light on what 
has become of his little boy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Hall was in a very different state of mind from when she had denied
all knowledge to Herbert, a mere boy, whom she did not like, and when she 
was anxious to shelter her daughter, whose silence had by this time begun 
to offend her.&nbsp; The sight of the clergyman and the other gentleman 
alarmed her, and she began by maundering out&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am sure, sir, I don&rsquo;t know nothing.&nbsp; My daughter 
have never writ one line to me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He was with her!&rsquo; gasped out Lord Northmoor.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am sure, sir, it was none of my doing, no, nor my daughter 
wouldn&rsquo;t neither, only the young lady over persuaded her.&nbsp; 
&rsquo;Tis she as was the guilty party, as I&rsquo;ll always 
say.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She&mdash;who?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Miss Morton&mdash;Miss Hida, sir; and my gal wouldn&rsquo;t never
have done it, sir, but for the stories <!-- page 256--><a 
name="page256"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 256</span>she told, fictious 
stories they was, I&rsquo;m sure, that the child wasn&rsquo;t none of my 
lady&rsquo;s, only a brat picked up in foreign parts to put her brother out
of his chance.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What are you saying?&rsquo; exclaimed Lord Northmoor.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;My niece never could have said any such thing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Indeed, but she did, sir, my Lord, and that&rsquo;s what worked 
on my daughter, though I always told her not to believe any such nonsense; 
but then you see, she couldn&rsquo;t get her passage paid to go out with 
Rattler, and Miss Hida give her the money if so be she would take off the 
child to Canada with her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And where?&rsquo; hoarsely asked the father.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That I can&rsquo;t tell, my Lord; Louey have never written, and I
knows no more than nothing at all.&nbsp; She&rsquo;ve not been a dutiful 
gal to me, as have done everything for her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>There was no more to be made out of Mrs. Hall, and they went their 
way.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There is no doubt that the little fellow is alive,&rsquo; said 
Mr. Deyncourt.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who can guess what those wretches have done to him?&rsquo; said 
Lord Northmoor under his breath.&nbsp; &lsquo;Not that I am unthankful for 
the blessed hope,&rsquo; he added, uncovering his head, &lsquo;but I am 
astounded more than I can say, by <i>this</i>&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It must be invention of the woman,&rsquo; said Mr. Deyncourt.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I hope so,&rsquo; was the answer.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Could Miss Rollstone have suspected it?&nbsp; She was very unlike
what I have seen of her before.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 257--><a name="page257"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
257</span>They separated for breakfast, agreeing to meet afterwards to hunt
up the Jones family.</p>
<p>Ida had suffered a good deal all the night and morning as she wondered 
what her confession might entail on her.&nbsp; Sometimes she told herself 
that since it would come out in Herbert&rsquo;s letters on the discovery of
the child, it was well to have the honour of the first disclosure, and her 
brother was certain to keep her part in the matter a secret; but, on the 
other hand, she did not know how much Louisa might have told her mother, 
nor whether Mrs. Hall might persist in secrecy&mdash;nay, or even 
Rose.&nbsp; Indeed, she was quite uncertain how much Rose had 
understood.&nbsp; She could not have kept back guesses, and she did not 
believe in honour on Rose&rsquo;s part.&nbsp; So she was nervous on finding
that her uncle was gone out.</p>
<p>When he came in to breakfast, he merely made a morning greeting.&nbsp; 
Afterwards he scarcely spoke, except to answer an occasional remark from 
her mother.&nbsp; To herself, he neither looked nor spoke, but when Mrs. 
Morton declared that he looked the better for his morning walk, there was a
half smile and light in his eye, and the weight seemed gone from his 
brow.&nbsp; Mrs. Morton asked what he was going to do.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am going out with Mr. Deyncourt,&rsquo; he answered.</p>
<p>And Ida breathed more freely when he was gone.</p>
<p>But she little knew that Mr. Deyncourt had gone to Rose Rollstone in her
father&rsquo;s presence, and told her of Mrs. Hall&rsquo;s revelations, 
asking her if this <!-- page 258--><a name="page258"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 258</span>had been the cause of her silence.&nbsp; She 
had to own how the truth had flashed at once on her and Mr. Morton.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It would be so very dreadful for them if it were known,&rsquo; 
she said.&nbsp; &lsquo;He thought if he brought back the boy, his 
sister&rsquo;s part need not be known.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then that was the secret!&rsquo; exclaimed Mrs. Rollstone.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll not blame you, child, but you might have told 
us.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Secrets were safe with the ex-butler, but not quite so much so with his 
wife, though all three tried to impress on her the need of silence, before 
Mr. Deyncourt hastened out to rejoin Lord Northmoor.&nbsp; The inquiry took
a much longer time than they had expected, for the family wanted did not 
live in Mr. Deyncourt&rsquo;s district, and they were misdirected more than
once to people who disdained the notion of being connected with the 
Rattler, if they had ever heard of such a person.&nbsp; At last they did 
find a sister-in-law, who pronounced George Jones to be a good fellow, so 
far as she knew.&nbsp; He sent home to his mother regularly, and lately had
had out his brother Sam, and a good job too, to have him out of the way, 
only what must he do but go and marry that there trollopy girl, as was no 
good.</p>
<p>Yes, George had written to say they had come safe to Toronto, but she 
did not hear as he said anything about a child.&nbsp; The letter was to his
mother, who had taken it into the country when she went to stay with her 
daughter.&nbsp; This deponent didn&rsquo;t know the address, and her 
husband was out with a yacht.</p>
<p>Nothing could be done but to pursue the mother <!-- page 259--><a 
name="page259"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 259</span>to a village about 
five miles off, where she was traced out with some difficulty, and 
persuaded to refer to her son George&rsquo;s letter, where he mentioned the
safe arrival of Mr. and Mrs. Sam, but without a word about their bringing a
child with them.&nbsp; This omission seemed to dash all former hopes, so as
to show Frank how strong they had been, and besides, there had been more 
than time for Herbert to have written after reaching Toronto.</p>
<p>However, the one step of knowing George Jones&rsquo;s address had been 
gained, and with no more than this, they had to return, intending to see 
whether Ida had any notion as to what was to be done.</p>
<p>It was evening when Lord Northmoor came in.&nbsp; Mrs. Morton was alone,
and as she looked up, was answered by his air of disappointment as he shook
his head.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, it is so dreadful,&rsquo; she exclaimed, &lsquo;it is all 
over the place!&nbsp; We met Mr. Brady and his sisters, and they cut Ida 
dead.&nbsp; She is quite broken-hearted, indeed, she is.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then she has told you all?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She could not help it.&nbsp; Mrs. Rollstone came to ask me if it 
was true&mdash;as a friend, she said, I should say it was more like an 
enemy, and Mrs. Hall came too, wanting to see Ida, but I saw her 
instead.&nbsp; The wicked woman to have given in!&nbsp; And they have gone 
and told every one, and the police will be after my poor child.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, they would not interfere unless I prosecuted, and that I 
certainly should not do unless it proved the only means of tracing my 
child.&nbsp; I came home intending to ask Ida if she gave any directions 
<!-- page 260--><a name="page260"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
260</span>about him.&nbsp; It seems certain that he was not brought to 
Toronto.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Indeed!&nbsp; She made sure that he would be there!&rsquo; 
exclaimed Mrs. Morton, much dismayed.&nbsp; &lsquo;Let me go and see.&nbsp;
She is so much upset altogether that she declares that she cannot see you 
this evening.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Morton went, and presently brought word that Ida was horrified at 
hearing that little Michael was not with the Joneses.&nbsp; She had trusted
Louisa to treat him kindly, and only dispose of him to some of those 
Canadian farmers, who seemed to have an unlimited appetite for adopted 
children, and the last hope was that this might have been the case, though 
opportunities could have been few on the way to Toronto.</p>
<p>Ida had cried over the tidings.&nbsp; It must have been worse than she 
had ever intended that the child should be treated; and the shock was great
both to her and to her mother.</p>
<p>Mrs. Morton really seemed quite broken down, both by sorrow and fear for
the boy, and by the shame, the dread of the story getting into the papers, 
and the sense that she could never go on living at Westhaven; and her 
brother-in-law quite overwhelmed her by saying that he should do all in his
power to prevent publicity, and that he entirely exonerated her from all 
blame in the matter.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, Frank dear,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;you are so good, it makes
me feel what a sinful woman I am!&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t mean that I ever gave
in for a moment to that nonsense of poor Ida&rsquo;s which was her only bit
of excuse.&nbsp; No one that had ever been a mother could, <!-- page 
261--><a name="page261"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 261</span>you know; 
but I won&rsquo;t say that I did not grumble at my boy losing his 
chances.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t wonder!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And&mdash;and I never would listen to you and Mary about poor 
Ida.&nbsp; I let her idle and dress, and read all those novels, and it is 
out of them she got that monstrous notion.&nbsp; You little know what I 
have gone through with that girl, Frank, so different from the other 
two.&nbsp; Oh! if I could only begin over again!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Perhaps,&rsquo; said Frank, full of pity, &lsquo;this terrible 
shock may open her eyes, and by God&rsquo;s blessing be the beginning of 
better things.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, Frank, you are a perfect angel ever to bear the sight of us 
again!&rsquo; cried the poor woman, ever violent in her feelings and 
demonstrations.&nbsp; &lsquo;Hark!&nbsp; What&rsquo;s that?&mdash;I 
can&rsquo;t see any one.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Please, ma&rsquo;am, it&rsquo;s Miss Rollstone, with a letter for
his Lordship.&rsquo;</p>

THE CLUE</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;BEST OF ROSES,&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know where my uncle is, so please send him 
this.&nbsp; I got to Toronto all right, and had not much trouble in finding
out the steady-going Jones, who is rather a swell, chief mate on board the 
<i>British Empress</i>.&nbsp; He was a good deal taken aback by my story, 
and said that his brother had come out with his wife, but no child.&nbsp; 
It was quite plain that he was a good deal disappointed in the Rattler, and
not at all prepared for Mrs. Louisa, whom neither he nor his wife admired 
at all, at all.&nbsp; He had got his brother a berth on a summer steamer 
that had just been set up on Lake Winnipeg&mdash;being no doubt glad to get
rid of such an encumbrance as the wife, and he looked very blue when he 
heard that I was quite certain that she had taken the kid away with her, 
and been paid for it.&nbsp; There was nothing for it but to go after them, 
and find out from them what they had done with poor little Mite.&nbsp; He 
is a right good fellow, and would have gone with me, but that he is bound 
to his boat, and <!-- page 263--><a name="page263"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 263</span>a stunner she is; but he gave me a letter to 
Sam, so I had to get on the Canadian Pacific Railway, so that I should have
been nonplussed but for your loan.&nbsp; Splendid places it goes through, 
you never saw such trees, nor such game.</p>
<p>&lsquo;As good luck would have it, I was in the same car with an 
Englishman&mdash;a gentleman, one could see with half an eye, and we 
fraternised, so that I told him what I was come about.&nbsp; He was awfully
good-natured, and told me he lived a mile or two out of Winnipeg, and had a
share in the steam company, and if I found any difficulty I was to come to 
him, Mr. Forman, at Northmoor.&nbsp; I stared at the name, as you may 
guess!&nbsp; There was a fine horse and buggy waiting for him at the 
station, and off he went.&nbsp; I put up at the hotel&mdash;there&rsquo;s 
sure to be that whatever there is not&mdash;and went after the Joneses 
next.&nbsp; I got at the woman first, she looked ill and fagged, as if she 
didn&rsquo;t find life with Rattler very jolly.&nbsp; She cried bucketsful,
and said she didn&rsquo;t know anything, since she put the poor little Mite
to sleep after supper in a public-house at Liverpool.&nbsp; She was dead 
tired, and when she woke he was gone, and her husband swore at her, and 
never would tell her what he had done with the boy, except that he had not 
hurt him.&nbsp; Then I interviewed Sam Rattler himself.&nbsp; He cut up 
rough, as he said my Lord had done him an ill turn, and he had the game in 
his hands now, and was not going to let him know what was become of his 
child, without he came down handsome enough to make up for what he had done
him out of.&nbsp; So then I had to go off to Mr. Forman.&nbsp; He has such 
a place, <!-- page 264--><a name="page264"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
264</span>a house such as any one might be delighted to have&mdash;pine 
trees behind, a garden in front, no end of barns and stables, with houses 
and cows, fine wheat fields spreading all round, such as would do your 
heart good.&nbsp; That is what Mr. Forman and his brother-in-law, Captain 
Alder, have made, and there&rsquo;s a sweet little lady as ever you saw, 
Alder&rsquo;s sister.&nbsp; The Captain was greatly puzzled to hear it was 
Lord Northmoor&rsquo;s son I was looking for.&nbsp; He is not up in the 
peerage like your father, you see, and I had to make him understand.&nbsp; 
He thought Lord N. must be either the old man, or Lady Adela&rsquo;s little
boy.&nbsp; He said some of his happiest days had been at Northmoor, and he 
asked after Lady Adela, and if Miss Morton was married.&nbsp; He came with 
me, and soon made Mr. Rattler change his note, by showing him that it would
be easy to give him the sack, even if he was not laid hold of by the law on
my information for stealing the child.&nbsp; They are both magistrates and 
could do it.&nbsp; So at last the fellow growled out that he wasn&rsquo;t 
going to be troubled with another man&rsquo;s brat, and just before 
embarking, he had laid it down asleep at the door of Liverpool 
Workhouse!&nbsp; So no doubt poor little Michael is there!&nbsp; I would 
have telegraphed at once; but I don&rsquo;t know where my uncle is, or 
whether he knows about it, but you can find out and send him this letter at
once.&nbsp; I have asked him to pay your advance out of my quarter; and as 
to the rest of it, it is all owing to you that the poor little kid is not 
to grow up a pauper.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am staying on at Northmoor&mdash;it sounds natural; they want 
another hand for their harvesting, <!-- page 265--><a 
name="page265"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 265</span>so I am working out 
my board, as is the way here, at any rate till I hear from my uncle, and I 
shall ask him to let me stay here for good as a farming-pupil.&nbsp; It 
would suit me ever so much better than the militia, even if I could get 
into it, which I suppose I haven&rsquo;t done.&nbsp; It is a splendid 
country, big enough to stretch oneself in, and I shall never stand being 
cramped up in an island after it; besides that I don&rsquo;t want to see 
Ida again in a hurry, though there is some one I should like no end to see 
again.&nbsp; There, I must not say any more, but send this on to my 
uncle.&nbsp; I wish I could see his face.&nbsp; I did look to bring Mite 
back to him, but that can&rsquo;t be, as I have not tin enough to carry me 
home.&nbsp; I hope your loan has not got you into a scrape.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;Yours ever (I mean it),<br />
&lsquo;<span class="smcap">H. Morton</span>.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The letter to Lord Northmoor, which the servant put into his hand, was 
shorter, and began with the more important sentence&mdash;&rsquo;The rascal
dropped Michael at Liverpool Workhouse.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The father read it with an ejaculation of &lsquo;Thank God,&rsquo; the 
aunt answered with a cry of horror, so that he thought for a moment she had
supposed he said &lsquo;dropped him into the sea,&rsquo; and repeated 
&lsquo;Liverpool Workhouse.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, yes, yes; but that is so dreadful.&nbsp; The Honourable 
Michael Morton in a workhouse!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He is safe and well taken care of there, no doubt,&rsquo; said 
Frank.&nbsp; &lsquo;I have no fears now.&nbsp; There are much worse places 
than the nurseries of those great unions.&rsquo;&nbsp; Then, as he read on,
&lsquo;There, Emma, <!-- page 266--><a name="page266"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 266</span>your boy has acted nobly.&nbsp; He has fully 
retrieved what his sister has done.&nbsp; Be happy over that, dear sister, 
and be thankful with me.&nbsp; My Mary, my Mary, will the joy be too 
much?&nbsp; Oh, my boy!&nbsp; How soon can I reach Liverpool?&nbsp; There, 
you will like to read it.&nbsp; I must go and thank that good girl who 
found him the means.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He was gone, and found Rose in the act of reading her letter aloud (all 
but certain bits, that made her falter as if the writing was bad) to her 
parents and Mr. Deyncourt.&nbsp; And there, in full assembly, he found 
himself at a loss for words.&nbsp; No one was so much master of the 
situation as Mr. Rollstone.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My Lord, I have the honour to congratulate your Lordship,&rsquo; 
he said, with a magnificence only marred by his difficulty in rising.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&mdash;I,&rsquo; stammered his Lordship, with an unexpected 
choke in his throat, &lsquo;have to congratulate you, Mr. Rollstone, on 
having such a daughter.&rsquo;&nbsp; Then, grasping Rose&rsquo;s hand as in
a vice, &lsquo;Miss Rollstone, what we owe to you&mdash;is past 
expression.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am sure she is very happy, my Lord, to have been of 
service,&rsquo; said her mother, with a simper.</p>
<p>Mr. Deyncourt, to relieve the tension of feeling, said, &lsquo;Miss 
Rollstone was reading the letter about Mr. Morton&rsquo;s adventures.&nbsp;
Would you not like her to begin again?&rsquo;</p>
<p>And while Rose obeyed, Lord Northmoor was able to extract his 
cheque-book from his pocket-book, and as Rose paused, to say&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have a debt of which my nephew reminds me.&nbsp; Miss Rollstone
furnished the means for his <!-- page 267--><a name="page267"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 267</span>journey.&nbsp; Will you let me fill this 
up?&nbsp; This can be repaid,&rsquo; he added, with a smile, &lsquo;the 
rest, never.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Rollstone might have been distressed at the venture on which his 
daughter&rsquo;s savings had gone; but he was perfectly happy and 
triumphant now, except that, even more than Mrs. Morton, he suffered from 
the idea of the Honourable Michael being exposed to the contamination of a 
workhouse, and was shocked at his Lordship&rsquo;s thinking it would have 
been worse for him to be with the Rattler.&nbsp; Then, hastily looking at 
his watch, Lord Northmoor asked when the post went out, and hearing there 
was but half an hour to spare, begged Mr. Deyncourt to let him lose no time
by giving him the wherewithal to write to his wife.</p>
<p>&lsquo;She would miss a note and be uneasy,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;Yet I hardly know what I dare tell her.&nbsp; Only not mourning 
paper!&rsquo; he added, with an exultant smile.</p>
<p>In the curate&rsquo;s room he wrote&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Dearest Wife</span>,&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have been out all day, and have only a moment to say that I am 
quite well, and trust to have some most thankworthy news for you.&nbsp; 
Don&rsquo;t be uneasy if you do not hear to-morrow.&mdash;Your own</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<span 
class="smcap">Frank</span>.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There was still time to scribble&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Lady Adela</span>,&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I trust to you to prepare Mary for well-nigh incredible joy, but 
do not agitate her too soon.&nbsp; I cannot come till Friday afternoon.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;Yours gratefully,<br />
&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Northmoor</span>.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 268--><a name="page268"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
268</span>Having sent this off, his next search was for a time-table.&nbsp;
He would fain have gone by the mail train that very night, but Mr. 
Deyncourt and Mrs. Morton united in persuading him that his strength was 
not yet equal to such a pull upon it, and he yielded.&nbsp; They hardly 
knew the man, usually so equable and quiet as to be almost stolid.</p>
<p>He smiled, and declared he could neither eat nor sleep, but he actually 
did both, sleeping, indeed, better and longer than he had done since his 
illness, and coming down in the morning a new man, as he called himself, 
but the old one still in his kindness to Mrs. Morton.&nbsp; He promised to 
telegraph to her as soon as he knew all was well, assured her that he would
do his best to keep the scandal out of the papers, that he would never 
forget his obligations to Herbert&rsquo;s generosity, and that if she made 
up her mind to leave Westhaven he would facilitate her so doing.</p>
<p>Ida was not up.&nbsp; She had had a very bad night, and indeed she had 
confessed that she had been miserable under dreams worse than waking, ever 
since the child was carried off.&nbsp; Her mother had observed her 
restlessness and nervousness, but had set a good deal down to love, and 
perhaps had not been entirely wrong.&nbsp; At any rate, she was now really 
ill, and could not bear the thought of seeing her uncle, though he sent a 
message to her that now he did not find it nearly so hard to forgive her, 
and that he felt for her with all his heart.</p>
<p>It was this gentleness that touched Mrs. Morton <!-- page 269--><a 
name="page269"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 269</span>above all.&nbsp; 
Years had softened her; perhaps, too, his patience, and the higher tone of 
Mr. Deyncourt&rsquo;s ministry, and she was, in many respects, a different 
woman from her who had so loudly protested against his marrying Mary 
Marshall.</p>

THE HONOURABLE PAUPER</h2>
<p>Lord Northmoor&rsquo;s card was given to the porter with an urgent 
request for an interview with the Master of the workhouse.</p>
<p>He steadied his voice with difficulty when, on entering the office, he 
said that he had come to make inquiry after his son, a child of three and a
half years old, who had been supposed to be drowned, but he had now 
discovered had been stolen by a former nurse, and left at the gate of the 
workhouse, and as the Master paused with an interrogative &lsquo;Yes, my 
Lord?&rsquo; he added&mdash;&lsquo;On the night between the Wednesday and 
Thursday of Whitsun week, May the&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Children are so often left,&rsquo; said the Master.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;I will ascertain from the books as to the date.&rsquo;</p>
<p>After an interval really of scarcely a minute, but which might have been
hours to the father&rsquo;s feeling, he read&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;May 18th.&mdash;Boy, of apparently four years old, left on the 
steps, asleep, apparently drugged.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah!&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 271--><a name="page271"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
271</span>&lsquo;Calls himself Mitel Tent&mdash;name probably Michael 
Trenton.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Michael Kenton Morton.&rsquo;&nbsp; Then he reflected, &lsquo;No 
doubt he thought he was to say his catechism.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Does not seem to know parents&rsquo; name nor residence.&nbsp; 
Dress&mdash;man&rsquo;s old rough coat over a brown holland 
pinafore&mdash;no mark&mdash;feet bare; talks as if carefully brought 
up.&nbsp; May I ask you to describe him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Brown eyes, light hair, a good deal of colour, sturdy, large 
child,&rsquo; said Lord Northmoor, much agitated.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;There,&rsquo; holding out a photograph.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; said the Master, in assent.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And where&mdash;is he here?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He is at the Children&rsquo;s Home at Fulwood Lodge.&nbsp; 
Perhaps I had better ask one of the Guardians, who lives near at hand, to 
accompany you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>This was done, the Guardian came, much interested in the guest, and a 
cab was called.&nbsp; Lord Northmoor learnt on the way that the routine in 
such cases, which were only too common, was the child was taken by the 
police to the bellman&rsquo;s office till night and there taken care of, in
case he should be a little truant of the place, but being unclaimed, he 
spent a few days at the Union, and then was taken to the Children&rsquo;s 
Home at Fulwood.&nbsp; Inquiries had been made, but the little fellow had 
been still under the influence of the drug that had evidently been 
administered to him at first, and then was too much bewildered to give a 
clear account of himself.&nbsp; He was in confusion between his real home 
and Westhaven, and the difference between his <!-- page 272--><a 
name="page272"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 272</span>appellation and that 
of his parents was likewise perplexing, nor could he make himself clear, 
even as to what he knew perfectly well, when interrogated by official 
strangers who alarmed him.</p>
<p>Lord Northmoor was himself a Poor Law Guardian, and had no vague 
superstitions to alarm him as to the usage of children in workhouses; but 
he was surprised at the pleasant aspect of the nursery of the Liverpool 
Union, a former gentleman&rsquo;s house and grounds, with free air and 
beautiful views.</p>
<p>The Matron, on being summoned, said that she had from the first been 
sure, in spite of his clothes, that little Mike was a well-born, 
tenderly-nurtured child, with good manners and refined habits, and she had 
tried in vain to understand what he said of himself, though night and 
morning, he had said his prayers for papa and mamma, and at first added 
that &lsquo;papa might be well,&rsquo; and he might go home; but where home
was there was no discovering, except that there had been journeys by puff 
puff; and Louey, and Aunt Emma, and Nurse, and sea, and North something, 
and &lsquo;nasty man,&rsquo; were in an inextricable confusion.</p>
<p>She took them therewith into a large airy room, where the elder 
children, whole rows of little beings in red frocks, were busied under the 
direction of a lively young nurse, in building up coloured cubes, 
&lsquo;gifts&rsquo; in Kindergarten parlance.</p>
<p>There was a few moments of pause, as all the pairs of eyes were raised 
to meet the new-comers.&nbsp; With a little sense of disappointment, but 
more of anxiety, Frank glanced over them, and encountered <!-- page 
273--><a name="page273"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 273</span>a rounded, 
somewhat puzzled stare from two brown orbs in a rosy face.&nbsp; Then he 
ventured to say &lsquo;Mite,&rsquo; and there followed a kind of laughing 
yell, a leap over the structure of cubes, and the warm, solid, rosy boy was
in his arms, on his breast, the head on his shoulder in indescribable 
ecstasy of content on both sides, of thankfulness on that of the 
father.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No doubt there!&rsquo; said the Guardian and the Matron to one 
another, between smiles and tears.</p>
<p>Mite asked no questions.&nbsp; Fate had been far beyond his 
comprehension for the last five months, and it was quite enough for him to 
feel himself in the familiar arms, and hear the voice he loved.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Would he go to mamma?&rsquo;</p>
<p>The boy raised his head, looked wonderingly over his father&rsquo;s 
face, and said in a puzzled voice&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Louey said she would take me home in the puff puff.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Come now with father, my boy.&nbsp; Only kiss this good lady 
first, who has been so kind to you.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Kiss Tommy too, and Fanny,&rsquo; said Michael, struggling down, 
and beginning a round of embraces that sufficiently proved that his nursery
had been a happy one, while his father could see with joy that he was as 
healthy and fresh-looking as ever, perhaps a little less plump, but with 
the natural growth of the fourth year, and he was much the biggest of the 
party, with the healthfulness of country air and wholesome tendance, while 
most of the others were more or less stunted or undergrown.</p>
<p>Lord Northmoor&rsquo;s longing was to take his recovered son at once to 
gladden his mother&rsquo;s eyes; <!-- page 274--><a 
name="page274"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 274</span>but Michael&rsquo;s 
little red frock would not exactly suit with the manner of his travels.</p>
<p>So he accepted the Guardian&rsquo;s invitation to come to his house and 
let Michael be fitted out there, an invitation all the more warmly given 
because it would have been a pity to let wife and daughters miss the 
interest of the sight of the lost child and his father.&nbsp; So, all 
formalities being complied with and in true official spirit, the account 
for the boy&rsquo;s maintenance having been asked for, a hearty and cordial
leave was taken of the Matron, and Michael Kenton Morton was discharged 
from Liverpool Union.</p>
<p>The lady and her daughters were delighted to have him, and would have 
made much of him, but the poor little fellow proved that his confidence in 
womankind had been shaken, by clinging tight to his father, and showing his
first inclination to cry when it was proposed to take him into another room
to be dressed.&nbsp; Indeed, his father was as little willing to endure a 
moment&rsquo;s separation as he could be, and looked on and assisted to see
him made into a little gentleman again in outward costume.</p>
<p>After luncheon there was still time to reach Malvern by a reasonable 
hour of the evening, and Frank felt as if every moment of sorrow were 
almost a cruelty to his wife.&nbsp; The Guardian&rsquo;s wife owned that 
she ought not to press him to sleep at her house, and forwarded his 
departure with strong fellow-feeling for the mother&rsquo;s hungry 
bosom.</p>
<p>From the station Frank sent telegrams to Herbert, to Mrs. Morton, and to
Rose Rollstone; <!-- page 275--><a name="page275"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 275</span>besides one to Lady Adela, containing only the
reference, Luke xv. 32.</p>
<p>People looked somewhat curiously at the thin, worn-looking, elderly man,
with the travelling bag in one hand, and the little boy holding tight by 
the other, each with a countenance of radiant gladness; and again, to see 
how, when seated, he allowed himself to be climbed over and clasped by the 
sturdy being, who seemed almost overwhelming to one so slight.</p>
<p>When the September twilight darkened into night, Michael, who had been 
asleep, awoke with a scream and flung both arms round his father&rsquo;s 
neck, exclaiming&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, Louey, I&rsquo;ll not cry!&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t let him throw me
out!&nbsp; Oh, the nasty man!&rsquo;</p>
<p>And even when convinced that no nasty man was present, and that it was 
papa, not Louey, whom he was grappling, he still nestled as close as 
possible, while he was only pacified in recurring frights by listening to a
story.&nbsp; Never good at story-telling, the only one that, for the nonce,
his father could put together was that of Joseph, and this elicited various
personal comparisons.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mine wasn&rsquo;t a coat of many colours, it was my blue 
frock!&nbsp; Did they dip it in blood, papa?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not quite, my darling, but it was the same thing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Then presently, &lsquo;It wasn&rsquo;t a camel, but a puff puff, and 
<i>he</i> was so cross!&rsquo;</p>
<p>By and by, &lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t tell anybody&rsquo;s dreams, 
papa.&nbsp; They didn&rsquo;t make me ride in a cha-rot, but nurse made me 
monitor, &lsquo;cause I knew all my letters.&nbsp; I <!-- page 276--><a 
name="page276"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 276</span>should like to have a
brother Benjamin.&nbsp; Mayn&rsquo;t Tommy be my brother?&nbsp; 
Wasn&rsquo;t Joseph&rsquo;s mamma very glad?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Michael&rsquo;s Egypt had not been a very terrible house of bondage, and
the darker moments of his abduction did not dwell on his memory; but years 
later, when first he tasted beer, he put down the glass with a shudder, as 
the smell and taste brought back a sense of distress, confusion, and horror
in a gas-lit, crowded bar, full of loud-voiced, rough figures, and 
resounding with strange language and fierce threats to make him swallow the
draught which, no doubt, had been drugged.</p>
<h2><!-- page 277--><a name="page277"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
277</span>CHAPTER XL<br />
JOY WELL-NIGH INCREDIBLE</h2>
<p>The midday letters were a riddle to the ladies at Malvern.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Out all day,&rsquo; said Mary, &lsquo;that is well.&nbsp; He will
get strong out boating.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I hope Herbert has come home to take him out,&rsquo; said 
Constance.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Or he may be yachting.&nbsp; I wonder he does not say who is 
taking him out.&nbsp; I am glad that he can feel that sense of 
enjoyment.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Yet that rejoicing seemed to be almost an effort to the poor mother who 
craved for a longer letter, and perhaps almost felt as if her Frank were 
getting out of sympathy with her grief&mdash;and what could be the good 
news?</p>
<p>&lsquo;Herbert must have passed!&rsquo; said Constance.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I hope he has, but the expression is rather strong for 
that,&rsquo; said Lady Adela.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Perhaps Ida is engaged to that Mr. Deyncourt?&nbsp; Was that his 
name?&rsquo; said Lady Northmoor languidly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh! that would be delicious,&rsquo; cried Constance, <!-- page 
278--><a name="page278"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 278</span>&lsquo;and 
Ida has grown much more thoughtful lately, so perhaps she would do for a 
clergyman&rsquo;s wife.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is Ida better?&rsquo; asked her aunt, who had been much drawn 
towards the girl by hearing that her health had suffered from grief for 
Michael.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mamma does not mention her in her last letter, but poor Ida is 
really much more delicate than one would think, though she looks so 
strong.&nbsp; This would be delightful!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yet, joy well-nigh incredible!&rsquo; said her aunt, 
meditatively.&nbsp; &lsquo;Were not those the words?&nbsp; It would not be 
like your uncle to put them in that way unless it were something&mdash;even
more wonderful, and besides, why should he not write it to me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh&mdash;h!&rsquo; cried Constance, with a leap, rather than a 
start.&nbsp; &lsquo;It can be only one thing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t, don&rsquo;t, don&rsquo;t!&rsquo; cried poor Mary; 
&lsquo;you must not, Constance, it would kill me to have the thought put 
into my head only to be lost.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Constance looked wistfully at Lady Adela; but the idea she had suggested
had created a restlessness, and her aunt presently left the room.&nbsp; 
Then Constance said&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Lady Adela, may I tell you something?&nbsp; You know that poor 
dear little Mite was never found?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh! a boat must have picked him up,&rsquo; cried Amice; 
&lsquo;and he is coming back.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Gently, Amy; hush,&rsquo; said the mother, &lsquo;Constance has 
more to tell.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Constance.&nbsp; &lsquo;My friend, Rose 
Rollstone, who lives just by our house at Westhaven, and was going back to 
London the night that Mite was lost, wrote to me that she was sure she had 
seen his <!-- page 279--><a name="page279"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
279</span>face just then.&nbsp; She thought, and I thought it was one of 
those strange things one hears of sights at the moment of death.&nbsp; So I
never told of it, but now I cannot help fancying&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh! I am sure,&rsquo; cried Amice.</p>
<p>Lady Adela thought the only safe way would be to turn the two young 
creatures out to pour out their rapturous surmises to one another on the 
winding paths of the Malvern hills, and very glad was she to have done so, 
when by and by that other telegram was put into her hands.</p>
<p>Then, when Mary, unable to sit still, though with trembling limbs, came 
back to the sitting-room, with a flush on her pale cheek, excited by the 
sound at the door, Lady Adela pointed to the yellow paper, which she had 
laid within the Gospel, open at the place.</p>
<p>Mary sank into a chair.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It can&rsquo;t be a false hope,&rsquo; she gasped.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He would never have sent this, if it were not a certainty,&rsquo;
said Adela, kneeling down by her, and holding her hands, while repeating 
what Constance had said.</p>
<p>A few words were spent on wonder and censure on the girl&rsquo;s 
silence, more unjust than they knew, but hardly wasted, since they relieved
the tension.&nbsp; Mary slid down on her knees beside her friend, and then 
came a silence of intense heart-swelling, choking, and unformed, but none 
the less true thanksgiving, and ending in a mutual embrace and an outcry of
Mary&rsquo;s&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, Adela! how good you are, you with no such 
hope&rsquo;&mdash;and that great blessed shower of tears that <!-- page 
280--><a name="page280"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 280</span>relieved her
was ostensibly the burst of sympathy for the bereaved mother with no such 
restoration in view.&nbsp; Then came soothing words, and then the endeavour
with dazed eyes and throbbing hearts to look out the trains from Liverpool,
whence, to their amazement, they saw the telegram had started, undoubtedly 
from Lord Northmoor.&nbsp; There was not too large a choice, and finally 
Lady Adela made the hope seem real by proposing preparations for the 
child&rsquo;s supper and bed&mdash;things of which Mary seemed no more to 
have dared to think than if she had been expecting a little spirit; but 
which gave her hope substance, and inspired her with fresh energy and a new
strength, as she ran up and downstairs, directing her maid, who cried for 
joy at the news, and then going out to purchase those needments which had 
become such tokens of exquisite hope and joy.&nbsp; After this had once 
begun, she seemed really incapable of sitting still, for every moment she 
thought of something her boy would want or would like, or hurried to see if
all was right.</p>
<p>Constance begged again and again to run on the messages, but she would 
not allow it, and when the girl looked grieved, and said she was tiring 
herself to death, Lady Adela said&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My dear, sitting still would be worse for her.&nbsp; However it 
may turn out, fatigue will be best for her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Surely it can&rsquo;t mean anything else!&rsquo; cried 
Constance.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t see how it can.&nbsp; Your uncle weighs his words 
too much to raise false hopes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>So, dark as it was by the time the train was <!-- page 281--><a 
name="page281"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 281</span>expected, Adela 
promoted the ordering a carriage, and went herself with the trembling Mary 
to the station, not without restoratives in her bag, in case of, she knew 
not what.&nbsp; Not a word was spoken, but hands were clasped and hearts 
were uplifted in an agony of supplication, as the two sat in the dark on 
the drive to the station.&nbsp; Of course they were too soon, but the 
driver man&oelig;uvred so as to give them a full view of the exit&mdash;and
then came that minute of indescribable suspense when the sounds of arrival 
were heard, and figures began to issue from the platform.</p>
<p>It was not long&mdash;thanks to freedom from luggage&mdash;before there 
came into full light a well-known form, with a little half-awake boy 
holding his hand.</p>
<p>Then Adela quietly let herself out of the brougham, and in another 
moment her clasping hand and swimming eyes had marked her greeting.&nbsp; 
She pointed to the open door and the white face in it, and in one moment 
more a pair of arms had closed upon Michael, and with a dreamy murmur, 
&lsquo;Mam-mam, mam-ma,&rsquo; the curly head was on her bosom, the 
precious weight on her lap, her husband by her side, the door had closed on
them, they were driving away.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh! is it real?&nbsp; Is he well?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Perfectly well!&nbsp; Only sleepy.&nbsp; Strong, grown, well 
cared for.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My boy, my boy,&rsquo; and she felt him all over, gazed at the 
rosy face whenever a tantalising flash of lamplight permitted, then kissed 
and kissed, till the boy awoke more fully, with another &lsquo;Mamma! 
Mamma,&rsquo; putting his hand to feel for her chain, as <!-- page 282--><a
name="page282"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 282</span>if to identify 
her.&nbsp; Then with a coo of content, &lsquo;Mite has papa and 
mamma,&rsquo; and he seemed under the necessity of feeling them both.</p>
<p>Only at their own door did those happy people even recollect Lady Adela,
with shame and dismay, which did not last long, for she came on them, 
laughing with pleasure, and saying it was just what she had intended, while
Mite was recognising his Amy and his Conny, and being nearly devoured by 
them.</p>
<p>He still was rather confused by the strange house.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;It&rsquo;s not home,&rsquo; he said, staring round, and blinking at 
the lights; &lsquo;and where&rsquo;s my big horse?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You shall soon go home to the big horse&mdash;and Nurse Eden, 
poor nurse shall come to you, my own.&rsquo;</p>
<p>To which Michael responded, holding out a plump leg and foot for 
admiration.&nbsp; &lsquo;I can do mine own socks and bootses now, and wash 
mine own hands and face.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Nevertheless, he was quite sleepy enough to be very happy and content to
be carried off to his mother&rsquo;s bedroom, where he sat enthroned on her
lap, Constance feeding him with bread and milk, while Amice held the bowl, 
and the maid, almost equally blissful, hovered round, and there again he 
sat with the two admiring girls one at each foot, disrobing him, as best 
they might.</p>
<p>Nearly asleep at last, he knelt at his mother&rsquo;s knee with the 
murmured prayer, but woke just enough to say, &lsquo;Mite needn&rsquo;t say
&ldquo;make papa better,&rdquo; nor &ldquo;bring Mite 
home.&rdquo;&lsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 283--><a name="page283"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
283</span>&lsquo;No, indeed, my boy.&nbsp; Say Thank God for all His 
mercy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He repeated it and added of himself, &lsquo;Bless nursey, and let Tommy 
and Fan have papas and mammas again.&nbsp; Amen.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He was nodding again by that time, but he held his mother&rsquo;s hand 
fast with &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t go, Mam!&rsquo;&nbsp; Nor did she.&nbsp; She 
had asked no questions.&nbsp; To be alone with her boy and Him, whom she 
thanked with her whole soul, was enough for her at present.</p>

THE CANADIAN NORTHMOOR</h2>
<p>It was not till Lord Northmoor began to answer in detail the questions 
that were showered on him as he ate his late dinner, that he fully realised
the history of his recovered son even to himself.&nbsp; &lsquo;Liverpool 
Workhouse,&rsquo; and &lsquo;all owing to Herbert,&rsquo; were his first 
replies, and he had eaten his soup before Adela and Constance had 
discovered the connection between the two; nay, they were still more 
bewildered when Constance asked, &lsquo;Then Herbert found him 
there?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Herbert?&nbsp; Oh no, good fellow.&nbsp; He is in Canada, he went
after him there.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;To Canada?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes; that woman, the nursery girl Hall, kidnapped the child, 
Herbert followed her there, and found he had been dropped at 
Liverpool.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Then on further inquiries, Frank became sensible that he must guard the 
secret of Ida&rsquo;s part in the transaction.&nbsp; He hoped to conceal it
from all, except his wife, for it was hardly injustice to the Jones pair in
another hemisphere to let their <!-- page 285--><a name="page285"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 285</span>revenge bear the whole blame.&nbsp; Indeed, he
did not himself know that it was Ida&rsquo;s passion or Rose&rsquo;s 
mention of having seen Michael&rsquo;s face that had roused Herbert&rsquo;s
suspicion.</p>
<p>He had heard Herbert&rsquo;s account of his adventures in the letter to 
Rose with mere impatience to come to what related to his son, and it had 
made no impression on his mind; but when he took out his own much briefer 
letter, the address at Northmoor, and the sentences that followed, the 
brief explanation where to seek for Michael suggested much.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I doubt whether I could ever have got the rascal to speak out if 
it had not been for Captain Alder, with whose brother-in-law, Mr. Forman, I
had the luck to meet on the way.&nbsp; They were some of the first settlers
here, and have a splendid farm, export no end of wheat and ice, and have a 
share in the steam company.&nbsp; I am working out my board here for them 
till you are good enough to send me my quarter&rsquo;s allowance, deducting
the &pound;25 that Miss Rollstone helped me to, as there was no one else to
whom I could apply.&nbsp; I should like to stay here for good and all, and 
they would take me for a farming-pupil for less than you have been giving 
to my crammers, all in vain, I am afraid.&nbsp; The life would suit me much
better; they let me live with the family, and they are thorough right sort 
of people, religious, and all that&mdash;and Alder seemed to take an 
interest in me from the time he made out who I was, and, indeed, the place 
is named after our Northmoor, where he says he spent his happiest 
days.&nbsp; If you can pacify my mother, and if you would consent, I am 
sure I could do much better <!-- page 286--><a name="page286"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 286</span>here than at home, and soon be quite off your 
hands.&rsquo;</p>
<p>For the present, Lord Northmoor, who could only feel that he owed more 
than he could express to his nephew, sent the youth a bill such as to cover
his expenses, with permission, so far as he himself was concerned, to 
remain with these new friends, at least until there was another letter and 
time to consider this proposal.</p>
<p>At the same time, he wrote to Rose Rollstone, not only the particulars 
of Michael&rsquo;s history, but a request for those details about 
Herbert&rsquo;s friends to which he had scarcely listened when she read 
them.&nbsp; He sent likewise a paragraph to several newspapers, explaining 
that the Honourable M. K. Morton, whose &lsquo;watery grave&rsquo; had been
duly recorded, had in fact been only abducted by a former maid-servant, and
bestowed in Liverpool Workhouse, where he had been discovered by the 
generous exertions of his cousin, Herbert Morton, Esquire.&nbsp; It was 
hoped that this would obviate all suspicion of Ida, who was reported as 
still so unwell that her mother was anxious to carry her abroad at once to 
try the effect of change of scene.&nbsp; Upon which Frank consulted Mr. 
Hailes, as to whether the prosperity that had begun to flow in upon 
Northmoor would justify him in at once taking the house at Westhaven off 
her hands, and making it a thank-offering as a parsonage for the district 
of St. James.&nbsp; This break-up seemed considerably to lessen her 
reluctance to the idea of Herbert&rsquo;s remaining in Canada, as in 
effect, neither she nor Ida felt inclined as yet to encounter his 
indignation, or to let him hear what <!-- page 287--><a 
name="page287"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 287</span>Westhaven said.&nbsp;
There would be no strong opposition on her part, except the tears which he 
would not see; and she was too anxious to carry Ida away to think of much 
besides.</p>
<p>Frank had, however, made up his mind that he could not let the son of 
his only brother, the youth whom he had regarded almost as a son, and who 
had lost so much by the discovery of the child, drift away into 
expatriation, without being personally satisfied as to these new 
companions.&nbsp; This was ostensible reason enough for a resolution to go 
out himself to the transatlantic Northmoor to make arrangements for his 
nephew.&nbsp; Moreover, he was bent on doing so before the return of Mrs. 
Bury and Bertha, from whom the names of Alder and Northmoor were withheld 
in the joyful letters.</p>
<p>From Mr. Hailes he obtained full confirmation of what he had heard from 
Lady Adela&mdash;a story which the old gentleman&rsquo;s loyalty had 
withheld as mere gossip&mdash;about the young people who had been very dear
to him.</p>
<p>He confessed that poor Arthur Morton had a bad set about 
him&mdash;indeed, his father&rsquo;s tastes had involved him in the kind of
thing, and Lady Adela had been almost a child when married to him by 
relations who were much to blame.&nbsp; Captain Alder had belonged to the 
set, but had always seemed too good for them, and as if thrown among them 
from association.&nbsp; There was no doubt that he and Bertha were much in 
love, but there was sure to be strong opposition from her father, and even 
her brother had shown symptoms of thinking his friend had no business to 
aspire to his sister&rsquo;s hand.&nbsp; Moreover, <!-- page 288--><a 
name="page288"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 288</span>it appeared 
afterwards that the Captain was heavily in debt to Arthur Morton.&nbsp; It 
was under these circumstances that the accident occurred.&nbsp; Bertha had 
mistrusted the horse&rsquo;s eye and ear, and implored her brother not to 
venture on driving it, and had been bantered good-humouredly on her unusual
fears.&nbsp; At the first shock, the untamed girl had spoken bitter words, 
making Captain Alder accountable for the accident.&nbsp; What they were, 
neither Mr. Hailes nor any one else exactly knew, but they had cut 
deep.</p>
<p>When, on poor Arthur&rsquo;s recovery of consciousness, there was an 
endeavour to find Captain Alder, he had left the army; and though somewhat 
later the full amount of the debt was paid, it was conveyed in a manner 
that made the sender not easily traceable, and as it came just when Arthur 
was again past communication, and sinking fast, no great effort was made to
seek one who was better forgotten.</p>
<p>It had not then been known how Bertha&rsquo;s life would be wrecked by 
that sense of injustice and cruelty&mdash;nor what a hold the love of that 
man had taken on her; but like Lady Adela, Mr. Hailes averred that she had 
never been the same since that minute of stormy grief and accusation; and 
that he believed that, whatever might come of it, the being able to confess
her wrongs, and to know the fate of her lover, was the only thing that 
could restore the balance of her spirits or heal the sore.</p>
<p>From his own former employer, Mr. Burford, Frank procured that other 
link which floated in his memory when Lady Adela spoke.&nbsp; The name had 
<!-- page 289--><a name="page289"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
289</span>come into Mr. Burford&rsquo;s office because he had been engaged 
on the part of one of his clients in purchasing an estate of the Alder 
family, at a time which corresponded with Arthur Morton&rsquo;s death, and 
the payment of the debt.&nbsp; There was a second instalment of the price 
which had to be paid to a Quebec bank.</p>
<p>This was all that could be learnt; but it confirmed Lord 
Northmoor&rsquo;s impression that it would be right to see him, and as far 
as explanation could go, to repair the injustice which had stung him so 
deeply.&nbsp; A letter could not do what an interview could, and 
Herbert&rsquo;s plans were quite sufficient cause for a journey to 
Winnipeg.</p>
<p>Of course it was a wrench to leave his wife and newly-recovered son; but
he had made up his mind that it was right, both as an act of justice to an 
injured man, incumbent upon him as head of the family, and likewise as 
needful in his capacity of guardian to Herbert, while the possibility of 
bringing healing to Bertha also urged him.</p>
<p>However, Frank said little of all this, only quite simply, as if he were
going to ride to the petty sessions at Colbeam, mentioned that he thought 
it right to go out to Canada to see about his nephew.</p>
<p>And as soon as he had brought the party home, and seen his boy once more
in his own nursery, he set forth, leaving Mary to talk and wonder with Lady
Adela over the possible consequences.</p>
<h2><!-- page 290--><a name="page290"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
290</span>CHAPTER XLII<br />
HUMBLE PIE</h2>
<p>Bertha had just arrived from her tour, having rushed home on the tidings
of a quarrel between the doctors and the lady nurses of her pet hospital; 
and she had immediately dashed down to Northmoor to secure her cousin as 
one of the supporters.&nbsp; She sat by Lady Adela&rsquo;s fire, very much 
disconcerted at hearing that he was not come home yet, though expected 
every day.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What should he have gone off to Canada for?&nbsp; He might have 
been contented to stay at home, after having lost all this time by his 
illness.&nbsp; Oh, yes, I know that sounds ungrateful, when it was all in 
the cause of my little Cea.&nbsp; I shall be thankful to him all my life, 
but all the same, he ought to be at home when he is wanted, and I wonder he
liked to fly off just when he had got his dear little boy back 
again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He did not like it, but thought it his duty.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Duty&mdash;what, to Herbert?&nbsp; Certainly the boy has come out
very well in this matter, considering that the finding Mite was to his own 
detriment; <!-- page 291--><a name="page291"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
291</span>but probably he has found his vocation as a colonist.&nbsp; Still
Northmoor might have let him find that for himself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do you know where the home he found is, Bertha?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Somewhere about Lake Winnipeg, isn&rsquo;t it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes; and the name is Northmoor.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Named by Herbert, eh?&nbsp; Or didn&rsquo;t John Tulse go 
out?&nbsp; Did he name the place in loyalty to us?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not John Tulse, but one who told Herbert that his happiest days 
were spent here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Adela, you mean something.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t tantalise me.&nbsp; 
Is it Fred Alder?&nbsp; And was he kind to the boy for old sake&rsquo;s 
sake, because he bore the old name?&nbsp; Did he think he was your 
Mike?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Bertha was leaning forward now, devouring Adela with her eyes.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He was much puzzled to understand who Herbert was, but he gave 
him great help.&nbsp; The man could hardly have been made to speak if he 
had not brought him to his bearings.&nbsp; Herbert has been living with him
and his brother-in-law ever since, and is going to remain as a 
farming-pupil.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Married of course to a nasal Yankee?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No.&rsquo;</p>
<p>There was a pause.&nbsp; Bertha drew herself back in her chair, Adela 
busied herself with the tea-cups.&nbsp; Presently came the 
question&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did Northmoor know?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, he did.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And was that the reason of his going out?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Herbert was one motive, but I do not think he would have gone if 
there had not been another reason.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 292--><a name="page292"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
292</span>&lsquo;You did not ask him?&rsquo; she said hotly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Certainly not.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t want any one to interfere,&rsquo; said Bertha, in a
suddenly changed mood, &lsquo;especially not such a stick as that.&nbsp; He
might have let it alone.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And if you heard that Captain Alder was&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A repentant prodigal, eh?&nbsp; A sober-minded, sponsible, 
easy-going, steady money-making Canadian,&rsquo; interrupted Bertha 
vehemently, &lsquo;such as approved himself to his Lordship&rsquo;s 
jog-trot mind.&nbsp; Well, what then?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, Birdie, perverse child as ever.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And so you actually despatched my Lord to eat humble pie in my 
name.&nbsp; You might have waited to see what I thought of the 
process.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Bertha jumped up, as if to go and take off her hat, but just at that 
moment some figures crossed the twilight window, and in another second 
Adela had sprung into the hall, meeting Mary and Frank, whom she beckoned 
into the dining-room.</p>
<p>Bertha had followed as far as the room door, when, in the porch, she 
beheld a tall large form, and bearded countenance.&nbsp; One moment more 
and those two were shut into the drawing-room.</p>
<p>Mary, Frank, and Adela stood together over the dining-room fire, all 
smiles and welcome.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Doesn&rsquo;t he look well?&rsquo; was Mary&rsquo;s cry, as she 
displayed her husband.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Better than ever.&nbsp; Nothing like bracing air.&nbsp; Oh! I am 
glad you brought <i>him</i>&rsquo; indicating the other room, &lsquo;down 
at once; she might have had a naughty fit, and tormented herself and 
everybody.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You think it will be all right?&rsquo; said Frank <!-- page 
293--><a name="page293"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
293</span>anxiously.&nbsp; &lsquo;It was a venture, but when he heard that 
she was at the Dower House, there was no holding him.&nbsp; He thinks she 
has as much to forgive as he has.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You wrote something of that&mdash;though the actual misery and 
accident were no fault of his, poor fellow, and yet&mdash;yet all that 
self-acted and re-acted on one another, and did each other harm,&rsquo; 
said Adela.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Frank; &lsquo;harm that he only fully understood
gradually, after he had burst away from it all in the shock, and was living
a very different life with his little sister, and afterwards with her 
husband, a thoroughly good man.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;To whom you have trusted your nephew?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Entirely.&nbsp; Herbert is very happy there, much more so than 
ever before, useful and able to follow his natural bent.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am very glad he will do well there.&rsquo;</p>
<p>A sudden interruption here came on them in the shape of Amice, who had 
not been guarded against.&nbsp; She flew into the room in a fright, 
exclaiming&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mamma, mamma, there&rsquo;s a strange man like a black bear in 
the drawing-room, and he has got his arm round Aunt Bertha&rsquo;s 
waist.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; as she perceived Lord Northmoor.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A Canadian bear I have just brought home, eh, Amy?&rsquo; said 
he, exhilarated into fun for once, while Lady Adela indulged in a quiet 
smile at the manner of partaking of humble pie.</p>
<p>Amice had, however, broken up the <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i>,
and all were soon together again, Lady Adela greeting Captain Alder as an 
old friend, and he, in the restraint of good breeding, betraying none of 
his <!-- page 294--><a name="page294"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
294</span>feeling at the contrast between the girlish wife and the faded 
widow, although perhaps in very truth Adela Morton was a happier, certainly
a more peaceful woman now than in those days.</p>
<p>All must spend the evening together.&nbsp; Where?&nbsp; The Northmoors 
carried the day, Adela and Bertha must come up to dinner, yes, and Amice 
too.&nbsp; It was fine moonlight and the Captain would stay and escort 
them.</p>
<p>Meantime Lord and Lady Northmoor revelled in a moonlight walk together 
exactly as they had done seven years before as a bride and bridegroom, but 
with that further ingredient in joy before them&mdash;that nightly romp 
with their Mite, to which Frank had been looking forward all through his 
voyage.&nbsp; Their Mite all the happier because his Tom and Fanny were at 
the keeper&rsquo;s lodge, and allowed to play with him in the garden, and 
on the heath.</p>
<p>Six weeks later, Lord Northmoor acted as father at Bertha&rsquo;s 
wedding, a quiet one, with Constance and Amice as bridesmaids, with, as 
supernumerary, little Boadicea, who was to share the new Canadian home.</p>
<p>Michael was there in the glory of his first knickerbockers, and Mrs. 
Bury was there, and her last words ere the bride came down dressed for the 
journey were, &lsquo;How about &ldquo;that stick,&rdquo; my 
dear?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah! sticks are sometimes made of good material.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There is a tree that groweth by the Water Side,&rsquo; said 
Adela.</p>
<h2><!-- page 295--><a name="page295"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
295</span>CHAPTER XLIII<br />
THE STAFF</h2>
<p>Five years later almost all the members of the Morton family were met 
once more at Westhaven.</p>
<p>Ida was slowly dying.&nbsp; She had always been more or less delicate, 
and she had never entirely recovered the effect of the distress she had 
brought upon herself by that foolish crime towards her little cousin.&nbsp;
Her mother had joined Miss Gattoni, and they had roamed about the Continent
in the various resorts of seekers of health and of pleasure, hoping to 
distract her mind and restore her strength and spirits.&nbsp; For a time 
this sometimes seemed to succeed, and she certainly became prettier; but 
disappointment always ensued; a little over-exertion or excitement was sure
to bring on illness, and there were even more painful causes for her 
collapses.&nbsp; Her uncle&rsquo;s care had not been entirely able to 
prevent the publication of such a sensational story, known, as it was, to 
most people at Westhaven; in fact, he was only able to reach the more 
respectable papers; <!-- page 296--><a name="page296"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 296</span>and the society to which Miss Gattoni 
introduced them was just that which revelled in the society papers.&nbsp; 
So every now and then whispers would go about that Miss Morton was the 
heroine&mdash;or rather the villain&mdash;of the piece, and these were sure
ultimately to reach Miss Gattoni.&nbsp; And at Genoa they had actually been
at the same <i>table-d&rsquo;h&ocirc;te</i> with Tom Brady&rsquo;s 
sister&mdash;nay, they had seen the <i>Morna</i> in the harbour.</p>
<p>Gradually each summer brought less renovation; each winter, wherever 
spent, brought Ida lower, till at length she was ill enough for her mother 
thankfully to reply to Constance&rsquo;s entreaty to come out to them at 
Biarritz.</p>
<p>Constance had grown to be in her vacation more and more the child of the
house at Northmoor, and since her college career had ended with credit 
externally, and benefit inwardly, she had become her aunt&rsquo;s right 
hand, besides teaching Amice music and beginning Michael&rsquo;s Latin; but
it was plain that her duty lay in helping to nurse her sister, and her 
uncle escorted her.&nbsp; They were greatly shocked at the change in the 
once brilliant girl, and her broken, dejected manner, apparently incapable 
of taking interest in anything.&nbsp; She would scarcely admit her uncle at
first, but when she discovered that even Constance was in perfect ignorance
of her part in the loss of Michael, she was overcome with the humiliation 
of intense gratitude, and the sense of a wonderful forgiveness and 
forbearance.</p>
<p>He never exactly knew what he had said to her; but for the two days that
he was able to remain, she <!-- page 297--><a name="page297"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 297</span>wished for him to sit with her as much as 
possible, though often in silence; and she let him bring her the English 
chaplain.</p>
<p>No one expected her to live through the spring, but with it came another
partial revival, and therewith a vehement desire to see Westhaven 
again.&nbsp; It was as if her uncle had extracted the venom of the sting of
remorse, and when that had become repentance, the old affection for the 
home of her childhood was free to revive.&nbsp; Good Mr. Rollstone was 
dead, but his wife and daughter kept on the lodging-house, and were 
affectionately glad to welcome their old friends.&nbsp; Herbert, who had 
been happily farming for two years on his own account, on an estate that 
his uncle had purchased for him, came for the first time on a visit from 
the Dominion&mdash;tall, broad, bearded, handsome, and manly, above all, in
his courtesy and gentleness to the sick sister who valued his strong and 
tender help more than any other care.&nbsp; Mary came with her husband and 
boy from Northmoor for the farewell.&nbsp; When Ida tearfully asked her 
forgiveness, the injury was so entirely past that it was not hard to say, 
in the spirit of Joseph&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, my poor child, do not think of that!&nbsp; No one has 
suffered from it so much as you have.&nbsp; It really did Michael no harm 
at all, only making a little man of him; and as to Herbert, his going out 
was the best thing in the world for him, dear, noble, generous 
fellow.&nbsp; And after all, Ida,&rsquo; she added, presently, &lsquo;I do 
believe you had rather be as you are now than the girl you were 
then?&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 298--><a name="page298"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
298</span>&lsquo;Oh, Aunt Mary, it is what Uncle Frank and you 
are&mdash;that&mdash;makes one feel&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ida could say no more.&nbsp; She once saw Michael&rsquo;s bright boyish 
face awed into pity, and had the kiss that sealed her earthly pardon, 
unconscious as he was of the evil she had attempted.&nbsp; There was the 
pledge of higher pardon, before her uncle and aunt left her to those nearer
who could minister to her as she went down to the River ever flowing.</p>
<p>Before that time, however, Herbert had made known to Rose one of his 
great reasons for settling in Canada, namely, that he meant to take her 
back with him.&nbsp; He had told his uncle long ago, and Mrs. Alder was 
quite ready and eager to welcome her as a cousin.&nbsp; Even Mr. Rollstone 
could hardly have objected under these circumstances, and Rose only doubted
about leaving her mother.&nbsp; It presently appeared, however, that Mrs. 
Morton wished to remain with Mrs. Rollstone.&nbsp; Westhaven was more to 
her than any other place, and her vanity had so entirely departed that she 
could best take comfort in her good old friend&rsquo;s congenial 
society.&nbsp; Constance offered to remain and obtain some daily governess 
or high school employment there; but it was to her relief that she found 
that the two old ladies did not wish it.&nbsp; There was a sense that her 
tastes and habits were so unlike theirs that they would always feel her to 
be like company and be on their best behaviour, and decidedly her mother 
would not &lsquo;stand in her light,&rsquo; and would be best contented 
with visits from her and to Northmoor.</p>
<p>So, after the quietest of weddings in the beautiful <!-- page 299--><a 
name="page299"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 299</span>St. James&rsquo;s 
Church, Herbert and Rose went out to be welcomed at Winnipeg, and Constance
returned with her uncle to be a daughter to Aunt Mary&mdash;till such time

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://www.gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any

distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
